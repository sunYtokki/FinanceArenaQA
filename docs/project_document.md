## FinanceQA AI Agent: Project Documentation
### Project Overview: The FinanceQA Agent
The FinanceQA Agent is a specialized, LLM-powered financial analyst designed to address the complex queries of the FinanceQA benchmark. At its core, the agent employs a minimal yet effective multi-step reasoning process, enhanced by a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for context-aware analysis.

The agent's primary capability is a streamlined, three-step agentic reasoning process—Analysis, Context/RAG, and Synthesis—that deconstructs intricate financial problems into a transparent and manageable sequence. This process is supported by a context-aware RAG system that intelligently searches a Kaggle financial Q&A dataset for relevant reasoning patterns and can route queries to company-specific documents, such as 10-K filings. The system is built upon a modular, tool-based architecture, ensuring flexibility, extensibility, and graceful degradation if a specific tool or step is unavailable.

### Architectural Design and Philosophy
The design prioritizes clarity, modularity, and maintainability. This philosophy is reflected in a microservice-inspired modular design, a simplified reasoning chain, and a pluggable, model-agnostic approach.

**Microservice-Inspired Modularity**: Capabilities are implemented as independent, composable modules with clear responsibilities (agent, rag, models). This separation of concerns, similar to a microservices philosophy, allows for easy extension, independent testing, and clear boundaries between components. RAG is treated as a distinct tool, not an overarching agent wrapper.

**Pluggable, Model-Agnostic Design**: A key principle is the decoupling of logic from specific LLMs. The model_manager provides a unified interface, allowing the agent's core reasoning model to be switched (e.g., from a local Ollama model to GPT-4) via configuration. This same principle applies to the evaluation module, where the llm_scorer can use a different, independently configured LLM for scoring results.

**Simplified Reasoning Chain**: A linear, three-step chain (Analysis → Context RAG → Synthesis) was chosen over more complex branching logic to prioritize debuggability and maintainability.

**Multi-Source Knowledge Routing**: The RAG system intelligently directs queries to the most appropriate data source—10-K documents for company-specific data, a Q&A dataset for general concepts, or both for hybrid queries.

### Key Design Decisions and Trade-offs
The development process involved several critical decisions that balanced complexity, performance, and development velocity.

**Simplified Reasoning Chain (7 steps → 3 steps):** The most significant decision was to consolidate a complex, seven-step process into a linear three-step flow. The trade-off was accepting less granular step tracking in exchange for significant gains in development velocity, clearer reasoning, and easier debugging given time and resource constraint.

**Local Development with Ollama:** To manage costs and accelerate iteration, local Ollama models were used for development. This involved the initial setup complexity of local models but provided the long-term benefit of avoiding recurring API costs, a trade-off made viable by the model-agnostic architecture.

### Performance Evaluation
The agent's performance was evaluated against the 148 questions in the FinanceQA benchmark.

#### 1. Evaluation Methodology
A comprehensive evaluation suite was built to run the agent against the benchmark, generate responses, and score them for accuracy using an LLM-based semantic matching approach. The model used for scoring is fully configurable and independent of the agent's reasoning model. The evaluation can be run end-to-end with a single command:

```sh
# Run full dataset evaluation with RAG and LLM scoring
python src/evaluation/benchmark_runner.py \
    --use-llm-evaluation \
    --dataset-path data/datasets/financeqa \
    --output-dir results/
```


#### 2. Performance Comparison
The following table compares the performance of a basic agent against the agent enhanced with the three-step reasoning chain, both using a Qwen3 model. For context, the Qwen3 baseline of 35.1% is comparable to the 39.2% baseline from the GPT-4o model cited in the original FinanceQA paper.

| Metric                   | Basic Qwen3 | Qwen3 With Reasoning Chain | Difference |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Overall Accuracy**     | 35.1%       | 35.8%                      | +0.7%      |
| **Basic Questions**      | 42.1%       | 39.5%                      | -2.6%      |
| **Assumption Questions** | 2.2%        | 2.2%                       | 0.0%       |
| **Conceptual Questions** | 54.7%       | 57.8%                      | +3.1%      |
| **Processing Time**      | 24.6s       | 64.0s                      | +160%      |

#### 3. Critical Analysis
While the agent demonstrates a modest improvement on conceptual questions, the overall performance gains are minimal. Three critical issues were identified:

**Stagnation on Assumption-Based Questions:** The agent showed no improvement on questions requiring financial assumptions. The initial hypothesis was that providing similar question-answer pairs via RAG would supply the necessary reasoning patterns. The lack of improvement suggests this approach is insufficient, potentially due to the quality of the dataset for this question type or, more likely, the need for a more sophisticated method than simple pattern matching to handle missing information.

**Processing Time Regression:** The reasoning chain introduced a 160% increase in processing time. This is an anticipated consequence of performing three sequential LLM inferences instead of one. However, the resulting 64-second average processing time presents a significant bottleneck for practical application and highlights the need for optimization.

**Basic Question Regression:** The accuracy on simple questions declined by 2.6%. This indicates that the added complexity of the reasoning chain may be over-engineering solutions for straightforward scenarios, introducing unnecessary points of failure.

### Future Improvements and Roadmap
Based on the analysis, the following strategic improvements are proposed to address the identified weaknesses:

**Fine-Tune a Core Model**: As demonstrated in the FinanceQA paper, fine-tuning offers the most significant potential for accuracy improvement. A promising approach would be to experiment with techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR), which excel with "verifiable" questions where answers can be confirmed, a category that aligns well with the FinanceQA dataset.

**Enhance the RAG System with a Reranker**: The current RAG system relies on a basic vector similarity search. To improve retrieval precision, the next iteration should implement a cross-encoder reranker. This would allow the system to more intelligently score and select the most relevant context, particularly if the embedding models are further enhanced with financial domain knowledge.

**Implement Smart Routing Logic**: To address the regression on basic questions and improve efficiency, a "smart routing" mechanism should be introduced. This would involve a preliminary classification step to identify simple, direct questions that can bypass the full reasoning chain, reserving the more computationally expensive process for complex queries.

**Optimize for Concurrency**: To tackle the processing time bottleneck, the evaluation system and agent architecture should be refactored to support concurrent question processing. This parallelization is critical for reducing evaluation times and moving closer to a practical, real-time solution.
