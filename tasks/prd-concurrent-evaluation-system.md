# Product Requirements Document: Concurrent Evaluation System

## Introduction/Overview

The current FinanceQA evaluation benchmark runner processes questions sequentially, creating a bottleneck that significantly increases evaluation time and slows development feedback loops. This feature will implement concurrent request handling to run multiple FinanceQA benchmark problems in parallel, dramatically improving evaluation efficiency while maintaining result accuracy and system stability.

The goal is to transform the evaluation system from a sequential processor to an intelligent concurrent executor that maximizes throughput while respecting resource constraints.

## Goals

1. **Performance**: Reduce total FinanceQA benchmark evaluation time by 60-80%
2. **Throughput**: Improve requests per second from current sequential rate to 5-15 concurrent questions
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Better utilize available CPU/memory through parallel processing
4. **Development Velocity**: Faster feedback loops for agent development and testing
5. **Reliability**: Maintain 100% result accuracy with robust error handling
6. **Scalability**: Support different concurrency levels based on available resources

## User Stories

**As a developer testing agent improvements:**
- I want evaluation runs to complete in minutes instead of hours
- I want to quickly validate changes across the full benchmark dataset
- I want reliable results even when some individual questions fail

**As a researcher analyzing agent performance:**
- I want to run multiple evaluation configurations in parallel
- I want detailed logging of concurrent execution performance
- I want the ability to compare results across different concurrency settings

**As a system operator:**
- I want the system to automatically choose optimal concurrency levels
- I want protection against resource exhaustion from too many concurrent requests
- I want clear visibility into execution progress and bottlenecks

## Functional Requirements

### Core Concurrency Features

1. **Parallel Question Processing**: The system must execute multiple FinanceQA benchmark questions simultaneously rather than sequentially.

2. **Intelligent Concurrency Selection**: The system must automatically determine optimal concurrency levels based on:
   - Available system resources (CPU cores, memory)
   - Model backend capabilities (Ollama vs OpenAI rate limits)
   - Question complexity distribution

3. **Fixed Maximum Concurrent Limit**: The system must enforce a configurable maximum number of concurrent requests (default: 10) to prevent resource exhaustion.

4. **Async/Await Architecture**: The system must use Python asyncio for thread-level parallelization with concurrent API calls to models.

5. **Progress Tracking**: The system must provide real-time progress updates showing completed/total questions and current concurrency level.

6. **Result Aggregation**: The system must collect and aggregate all question results, maintaining the same output format as the sequential version.

### Error Handling & Resilience

7. **Continue on Failure**: The system must continue processing remaining questions when individual questions fail, collecting both successful results and error details.

8. **Timeout Management**: The system must implement per-question timeouts to prevent individual slow questions from blocking the entire evaluation.

9. **Resource Monitoring**: The system must monitor memory usage and gracefully reduce concurrency if resource thresholds are exceeded.

10. **Detailed Error Reporting**: The system must log detailed information about failed questions, including error types, timestamps, and retry attempts.

### Configuration & Control

11. **Default Concurrency Settings**: The system must provide sensible default concurrency settings that work well across different environments without configuration.

12. **Environment-Aware Defaults**: The system must detect available system resources and adjust default concurrency accordingly (e.g., lower limits on resource-constrained systems).

13. **Runtime Configuration Override**: The system must allow concurrency settings to be overridden via command-line parameters for testing and optimization.

14. **Backward Compatibility**: The system must maintain the same CLI interface and output format as the existing sequential evaluator.

### Performance & Monitoring

15. **Execution Metrics**: The system must track and report:
    - Total execution time vs sequential baseline
    - Average questions per second
    - Resource utilization statistics
    - Concurrency efficiency metrics

16. **Bottleneck Detection**: The system must identify and report performance bottlenecks (e.g., model API rate limits, memory constraints).

17. **Graceful Degradation**: The system must automatically reduce concurrency if it detects performance degradation or resource pressure.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Agent Core Modification**: This feature will not modify the core agent reasoning logic or capabilities.

2. **Model Backend Changes**: This feature will not change how individual models (Ollama/OpenAI) process requests.

3. **Question Content Modification**: This feature will not alter the FinanceQA benchmark questions or expected answers.

4. **Distributed Computing**: This feature will not implement multi-machine distributed evaluation.

5. **Question Prioritization**: This feature will not implement intelligent question ordering or priority-based scheduling.

6. **Result Caching**: This feature will not implement result caching between evaluation runs.

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Requirements

- **Async Framework**: Implement using Python `asyncio` with `aiohttp` for concurrent HTTP requests
- **Worker Pool Pattern**: Use asyncio task pools to manage concurrent question processing
- **Resource Management**: Implement semaphores to control maximum concurrent operations
- **Integration Points**: Modify `src/evaluation/benchmark_runner.py` and related evaluation components

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Monitor memory usage per concurrent question to prevent OOM conditions
- **API Rate Limits**: Respect OpenAI API rate limits and implement backoff strategies
- **Local Model Scaling**: Optimize concurrent requests to local Ollama instances
- **Progress Reporting**: Implement efficient progress tracking without impacting performance

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Timeout Configuration**: Implement configurable per-question timeouts (default: 120 seconds)
- **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Partial Results**: Allow evaluation completion with partial results when some questions fail
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of concurrent execution events and performance metrics

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Evaluation Time Reduction**: Achieve 60-80% reduction in total benchmark evaluation time
- **Throughput Improvement**: Increase from ~1 question/minute to 5-15 questions/minute
- **Resource Utilization**: Improve CPU utilization from ~10-20% to 60-80%

### Reliability Metrics
- **Result Accuracy**: Maintain 100% consistency with sequential evaluation results
- **Stability**: Zero crashes or hangs during concurrent evaluation runs
- **Error Recovery**: Successfully complete evaluations even with 10-20% individual question failures

### Development Impact
- **Feedback Loop Speed**: Reduce development iteration time from hours to minutes
- **Testing Frequency**: Enable developers to run full evaluations 3-5x more frequently

## Open Questions

1. **Optimal Default Concurrency**: What concurrency level provides the best balance between speed and stability across different hardware configurations?

2. **Model-Specific Limits**: Should different concurrency limits be applied for OpenAI vs Ollama backends?

3. **Memory Usage Patterns**: How does memory usage scale with concurrent question processing, and what are safe limits?

4. **Error Rate Thresholds**: At what error rate should the system automatically reduce concurrency or halt execution?

5. **Progress Reporting Frequency**: How often should progress updates be displayed without impacting performance?

## Success Criteria

The feature will be considered successful when:
- FinanceQA benchmark evaluation completes in 60-80% less time than sequential baseline
- System maintains result accuracy and stability under concurrent load
- Developers can iterate on agent improvements 3-5x faster
- Resource utilization improves significantly without system instability
- Error handling gracefully manages partial failures and resource constraints
