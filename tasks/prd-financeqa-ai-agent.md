# PRD: FinanceQA AI Agent

## Introduction/Overview

This project aims to develop an AI agent that improves upon the current 54.1% baseline performance on the FinanceQA benchmark through a multi-step reasoning approach. The agent will leverage local models (Ollama) for development and OpenAI models for final validation, incorporating financial calculators, RAG systems, code execution, and document parsing capabilities to tackle complex financial analysis tasks that current non-agentic LLMs struggle with.

The core problem being solved is that traditional LLMs fail at the precision, multi-step reasoning, and domain-specific knowledge required for professional financial analysis, particularly in areas like hand-spreading metrics, accounting conventions, and reasoning with incomplete information.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Demonstrate superior reasoning and documentation quality over benchmark score optimization
2. **Secondary Goal**: Achieve meaningful improvement over 54.1% FinanceQA baseline
3. **Tertiary Goal**: Create a maintainable, well-architected system that showcases best practices
4. **Implementation Goals**:
   - Focus on benchmark-specific weaknesses (tactical questions, assumption handling)
      - Focus on assumption-based questions (2.2% → 10%+ accuracy)
   - Deliver clean, documented code suitable for evaluation
   - Implement basic tactical question handling


## User Stories

### Primary User: AI Researcher/Developer
- **As an AI researcher**, I want to evaluate the agent's performance on FinanceQA benchmark so that I can measure improvement over non-agentic baselines
- **As a developer**, I want clear documentation of the agent's reasoning process so that I can understand and extend the system
- **As a technical evaluator**, I want to see high-quality, modular code so that I can assess the implementation approach

### Secondary User: Finance Professional (Conceptual)
- **As a financial analyst**, I want an AI that can break down complex calculations into verifiable steps so that I can trust and validate the results
- **As a finance professional**, I want the system to handle incomplete information by making reasonable assumptions so that it mirrors real-world analysis workflows

## Functional Requirements

### Core Agent Architecture
1. The system must implement a multi-step reasoning agent that decomposes complex financial problems into sequential steps
2. The agent must maintain a clear reasoning chain that can be inspected and validated
3. The system must support both local development (Ollama) and production validation (OpenAI) models
4. The agent must implement error handling and graceful degradation when tools fail

### Financial Calculation Tools
5. The system must provide a financial calculator module supporting NPV, IRR, ratios, EBITDA adjustments, and other common metrics
6. The calculator must handle edge cases like negative cash flows, zero denominators, and missing data points
7. All calculations must show intermediate steps and assumptions made
8. The system must validate calculation inputs and provide meaningful error messages

### RAG System Integration
9. The system must implement a RAG pipeline for financial knowledge retrieval
10. The knowledge base must include accounting principles, valuation methods, and industry standards
11. The system must rank and filter retrieved context based on relevance to the specific question type
12. Retrieved information must be properly cited and attributed in the final response

### Code Execution Environment
13. The system must provide a secure Python execution environment for complex calculations
14. The agent must generate and execute code for multi-step financial analyses
15. Code execution must be sandboxed and include appropriate timeout mechanisms
16. Generated code must be readable and include comments explaining the financial logic

### Document Processing
17. The system must parse and extract information from financial documents (10-K forms, financial statements)
18. The parser must identify relevant sections (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, notes)
19. The system must handle different document formats and structures robustly
20. Extracted data must be validated and cleaned before use in calculations

### Question Type Handling
21. The agent must classify questions into categories: tactical-basic, tactical-assumption, and conceptual
22. For assumption-based questions, the agent must identify missing information and generate reasonable assumptions
23. The system must explain its assumptions and provide confidence levels
24. The agent must adapt its reasoning approach based on question type classification

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Real-time market data integration** - Focus on document-based analysis using provided context
- **Multi-modal capabilities** - No image or chart processing, text-only implementation
- **Production-grade security** - Basic sandboxing sufficient for evaluation purposes
- **Web interface** - Command-line/API interface only
- **Fine-tuning custom models** - Use existing pre-trained models only
- **Comprehensive financial knowledge base** - Focus on core concepts needed for benchmark
- **Advanced deployment features** - Local Docker support only, no cloud orchestration

## Design Considerations

### Architecture Pattern
- **Modular agent architecture** with separate components for reasoning, tool use, and knowledge retrieval
- **Plugin-based tool system** allowing easy addition of new financial calculation capabilities
- **Pipeline pattern** for document processing and question analysis workflows

### Model Integration
- **Dual model support**: Ollama for development/iteration, OpenAI for validation
- **Model-agnostic interfaces** to easily swap between different LLM providers
- **Prompt engineering** optimized for financial reasoning and step-by-step analysis

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy loading** of RAG components and large models to reduce startup time
- **Caching strategy** for expensive operations like document parsing and embedding generation
- **Async processing** where possible to improve responsiveness

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies and Framework
- **Primary Stack**: Python 3.9+, LangChain for agent orchestration
- **Model Integration**: Ollama SDK for local models, OpenAI API for validation
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB or FAISS for RAG implementation
- **Document Processing**: PyPDF2/pdfplumber for PDF parsing, pandas for data manipulation
- **Code Execution**: RestrictedPython or Docker for secure code execution

### Data Requirements
- **FinanceQA benchmark dataset** for evaluation
- **Financial knowledge corpus** (accounting principles, valuation methods)
- **Sample financial documents** for testing document parsing capabilities

### Integration Points
- **Model configuration** must support easy switching between Ollama and OpenAI
- **Tool registry** for dynamic discovery and loading of financial calculation modules
- **Evaluation harness** compatible with FinanceQA benchmark format

### Security and Safety
- **Code execution sandboxing** to prevent malicious code execution
- **Input validation** for all financial calculations and document processing
- **Rate limiting** for API calls to prevent quota exhaustion

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Overall FinanceQA score improvement** over 54.1% baseline
- **Assumption-based question accuracy** improvement (target: 5-15%)
- **Working demonstration** of core functionality
- **Documentation completeness** including agent card, design approach, and trade-offs analysis

### Secondary Metrics
- **Code coverage** ≥ 70% for core agent functionality
- **Modular design assessment** based on separation of concerns and interface clarity

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Agent Framework (2-3 hours)
- Set up project structure and dependencies
- Implement basic agent architecture with LangChain
- Create model switching infrastructure (Ollama ↔ OpenAI)
- Basic question classification and routing

### Phase 2: Financial Tools Integration (2-3 hours)

- Containerize with Docker if time permits

## Open Questions

1. **RAG Knowledge Scope**: What specific financial textbooks/sources should be included in the knowledge base for optimal benchmark performance?

2. **Code Execution Security**: Should we use Docker sandboxing or lightweight alternatives like RestrictedPython for the 4-8 hour timeframe?

3. **Model Selection Strategy**: Should we implement automatic model selection based on question complexity, or maintain manual switching?

4. **Evaluation Methodology**: How should we weight reasoning quality vs. benchmark score in the final evaluation?

5. **Error Recovery**: What fallback strategies should the agent employ when primary reasoning chains fail?

6. **Assumption Documentation**: What format should we use for documenting and tracking assumptions made during incomplete information scenarios?
