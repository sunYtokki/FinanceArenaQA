Since the information provided does not include the Diluted EPS for 2024, I will make some reasonable assumptions:\n\n1. Net Income: The net income for 2024 is not given in the text, but we can estimate it based on the operating income and other financial data. For simplicity, let's assume that the net income for 2024 is 90% of the operating income, which is $9,285 * 0.9 = $8,356.5.\n\n2. Stock Price: The stock price is also not provided in the text. I will use the average S&P 500 P/E ratio as a proxy for a large retail company like Costco. As of October 2021, the average S&P 500 P/E ratio was around 34.7 (source: https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pe-ratio).\n\nNow we can calculate the Diluted EPS and P/E ratio as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the number of shares outstanding: The text does not provide this information, but it is usually found in a company's annual report or financial statements. For simplicity, let's assume that Costco has 500 million shares outstanding.\n\n2. Calculate Diluted EPS: Diluted EPS = Net Income / Number of Shares Outstanding = $8,356.5 / 500,000,000 = $0.016713 (rounded to six decimal places for accuracy).\n\n3. Calculate P/E ratio: P/E ratio = Stock Price / Diluted EPS = Unknown stock price / $0.016713.\n\nSince the stock price is unknown, we cannot calculate the exact P/E ratio. However, using the average S&P 500 P/E ratio of 34.7 as a proxy, we can estimate that the P/E ratio for Costco in 2024 might be around 34.7 / $0.016713 = 2,068.9 (rounded to two decimal places).
