      "question": "What is Gross Profit in the year ending 2024?",
      "ground_truth": "$32,095 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the Gross Profit in the year ending 2024. I need to look at the financial statements provided to find this figure.\n\nFirst, I recall that Gross Profit is calculated as Total Revenue minus Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). In the context of the income statement, COGS is often listed as \"Merchandise costs\" or similar. \n\nLooking at the Consolidated Statements of Income, I see the line items under Revenue. The Total Revenue is listed as $254,453 million for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024. But Gross Profit isn't directly stated here. \n\nWait, the Operating Expenses section shows \"Merchandise costs\" at $222,358 million. That's the COGS. So Gross Profit should be Total Revenue minus Merchandise Costs. \n\nLet me verify. Total Revenue is $254,453 million. Merchandise costs are $222,358 million. So Gross Profit = 254,453 - 222,358 = $32,095 million. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way. Sometimes companies have different line items. But in this case, the income statement shows \"Net sales\" and \"Membership fees\" as parts of Total Revenue. The Merchandise costs are the main cost, so subtracting that from Total Revenue should give Gross Profit. \n\nLooking at the Operating Income line, it's $9,285 million. Operating Income is Gross Profit minus Operating Expenses (like Selling, General, and Administrative). So Gross Profit would be Operating Income plus Operating Expenses. \n\nOperating Expenses are Merchandise costs ($222,358) plus Selling, General, and Administrative ($22,810). Wait, no. Wait, the Operating Expenses section lists Merchandise costs and Selling, General, and Administrative. So Operating Income is Total Revenue minus Merchandise costs minus SG&A. \n\nWait, the statement says: \n\nREVENUE\nNet sales $249,625\nMembership fees 4,828\nTotal revenue 254,453\n\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nMerchandise costs 222,358\nSelling, general and administrative 22,810\nOperating income 9,285\n\nSo Operating Income = Total Revenue - Merchandise Costs - SG&A. Therefore, Gross Profit = Total Revenue - Merchandise Costs. \n\nSo Gross Profit = 254,453 - 222,358 = 32,095 million. \n\nLet me confirm with the numbers. 254,453 minus 222,358. Let's do the subtraction: 254,453 - 222,358. \n\n254,453 - 222,000 = 32,453. Then subtract 358 more: 32,453 - 358 = 32,095. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the Gross Profit for the year ending 2024 is $32,095 million. \n\nWait, but the question says \"Gross Profit in the year ending 2024\". The statement is for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, which is the fiscal year ending 2024. So that's the correct figure. \n\nI don't see any other line items that would affect this. The other expenses like interest are after operating income, so they don't factor into Gross Profit. \n\nSo the answer should be $32,095 million. But let me check if the problem expects it in a specific format. The context shows amounts in millions, so the answer should be in millions, probably written as 32,095. But the question says \"in the correct financial format\", so likely as a number with commas, like $32,095 million. But the instruction says \"concise, in the correct financial format\". \n\nLooking at the original context, they present numbers like $249,625, so the answer should be $32,095. But wait, the total revenue is 254,453, merchandise costs 222,358. 254,453 - 222,358 = 32,095. So the Gross Profit is $32,095 million. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 32,095 million, but written as $32,095 million. However, in the context, they use \"amounts in millions\", so the number itself is 32,095 (representing millions). So the answer should be 32,095. But the question says \"Gross Profit\", so the value is 32,095 million dollars. \n\nWait, the problem says \"provide the final answer in the required format\". The original context uses numbers like $249,625 (which is in millions), so the answer should be the number as presented, so 32,095. But to be precise, since it's in millions, the answer is 32,095. \n\nWait, but in the income statement, the numbers are presented as $249,625 (meaning $249,625 million). So Gross Profit would be $32,095 million. But the answer should be the number without the dollar sign and million, as per the context. For example, in the income statement, they list \"249,625\" under Net sales, which is in millions. So the answer should be 32,095. \n\nYes, so the final answer is 32,095.\n</think>\n\nGross Profit is calculated as Total Revenue minus Merchandise Costs. From the Consolidated Statements of Income for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024:\n- Total Revenue: $254,453 million\n- Merchandise Costs: $222,358 million\n- Gross Profit = $254,453 - $222,358 = $32,095 million\n\n<answer>:32,095",

      "question": "What is unadjusted EBITDA for the year ending in 2024?",
      "ground_truth": "$11,522 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about unadjusted EBITDA for Costco's 2024 fiscal year. First, I need to recall what EBITDA stands for—it's Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. The question specifies \"unadjusted,\" which probably means we shouldn't make any adjustments to the reported figures, just use the numbers directly from the financial statements.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, I need to find the relevant line items. EBITDA is typically calculated as operating income plus depreciation and amortization. Let me check the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nIn the income statement, under \"Operating Expenses,\" there's \"Operating income\" listed as $9,285 million for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024. Then, in the cash flow statement, under \"CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES,\" there's a line item for \"Depreciation and amortization\" of $2,237 million for 2024. \n\nSo, EBITDA should be Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization. That would be $9,285 + $2,237 = $11,522 million. \n\nWait, but the question says \"unadjusted.\" I should confirm if there's any other adjustment needed. The term \"unadjusted\" might mean not adjusting for things like non-cash items beyond depreciation, but in standard EBITDA calculation, it's just operating income plus D&A. The cash flow statement shows D&A as $2,237, which matches the income statement's operating expenses. \n\nLet me double-check the numbers. Operating income is $9,285 million. Depreciation and amortization is $2,237 million. Adding them gives $11,522 million. \n\nI should also check if there are any other items that might affect this. For example, sometimes companies have other non-operating items, but EBITDA is typically based on operating income. The income statement shows \"Operating income\" as $9,285, which is before interest and taxes. So adding back D&A (which is already subtracted in operating income) makes sense. \n\nWait, actually, operating income is calculated as revenue minus operating expenses (including D&A). So to get EBITDA, you add back D&A to operating income. Yes, that's correct. So $9,285 + $2,237 = $11,522 million. \n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, the \"Depreciation and amortization\" is listed as $2,237, which matches the $2,237 in the income statement's operating expenses. So that's consistent. \n\nI don't see any other adjustments mentioned in the context. The question specifies \"unadjusted,\" so no need to adjust for things like stock-based compensation or other non-cash items beyond D&A. \n\nTherefore, the unadjusted EBITDA for the year ending September 1, 2024, is $11,522 million.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate unadjusted EBITDA, we use the formula:  \n**Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization**.  \n\nFrom the Consolidated Statements of Income (52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024):  \n- Operating Income = $9,285 million  \n- Depreciation and Amortization (from Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows) = $2,237 million  \n\nEBITDA = $9,285 + $2,237 = **$11,522 million**.  \n\nThis is unadjusted as it uses directly reported figures without additional modifications.  \n\n<answer>:11522",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about adjusted EBITDA for Costco's 2024 fiscal year. First, I need to recall what EBITDA is. EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. Adjusted EBITDA usually means EBITDA with some non-recurring items added back or subtracted, but in this case, since the question doesn't specify adjustments, I'll assume it's the standard EBITDA.\n\nLooking at the financial statements provided, the Consolidated Statements of Income shows Operating Income as $9,285 million for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024. EBITDA is typically calculated as Operating Income plus Depreciation and Amortization. \n\nIn the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, under Operating Activities, there's a line item for Depreciation and Amortization of $2,237 million for 2024. So, to get EBITDA, I should add that to Operating Income.\n\nLet me verify: Operating Income is $9,285 million. Depreciation and Amortization is $2,237 million. So EBITDA = 9,285 + 2,237 = $11,522 million.\n\nWait, but the question asks for \"adjusted\" EBITDA. In some contexts, adjusted EBITDA might exclude certain items like stock-based compensation or lease expenses. However, looking at the provided data, the standard EBITDA calculation would be Operating Income plus Depreciation and Amortization. \n\nThe Cash Flow statement shows Depreciation and Amortization as $2,237, which is the same as the note in the income statement. The Operating Income is already after subtracting depreciation and amortization, so adding it back gives EBITDA.\n\nI should check if there are any other adjustments mentioned. The notes don't mention any specific adjustments for EBITDA, so it's safe to assume that the standard calculation applies here. \n\nSo, EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization = $9,285 + $2,237 = $11,522 million.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the numbers. The Operating Income is $9,285 million. The Depreciation and Amortization is $2,237 million. Adding them together: 9,285 + 2,237 = 11,522. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThe question is about the year ending in 2024, which matches the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024. So the numbers are for the correct period.\n\nI don't see any other adjustments mentioned in the context that would affect this calculation. The problem doesn't specify any particular adjustments, so the standard EBITDA should be the answer.\n\nTherefore, the adjusted EBITDA for the year ending 2024 is $11,522 million.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate adjusted EBITDA, we start with operating income and add back depreciation and amortization, as these are non-cash expenses excluded from EBITDA. From the Consolidated Statements of Income, operating income for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024, is $9,285 million. From the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depreciation and amortization is $2,237 million. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization  \n= $9,285 million + $2,237 million  \n= $11,522 million.\n\n<answer>:11522",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the unadjusted EBIT for the year ending in 2024. First, I need to recall what EBIT stands for—Earnings Before Interest and Taxes. But the question specifies \"unadjusted,\" so I should check if there's any adjustment needed beyond the standard EBIT calculation.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, specifically the Consolidated Statements of Income, I see the line items. The operating income is listed as $9,285 million for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024. \n\nWait, EBIT is typically calculated as operating income plus interest expense, but sometimes it's just operating income. However, the term \"unadjusted\" might mean they want the operating income before any adjustments, which is exactly what's listed. \n\nLet me confirm: Operating income is the line before \"Other Income (Expense)\" and \"Income Before Income Taxes.\" In the statement, Operating Income is $9,285 million. \n\nThe question says \"unadjusted EBIT.\" In some contexts, EBIT is the same as operating income, especially if there's no interest expense to add back. But let's check the other line items. Interest expense is listed as ($169) million, which is negative. So EBIT would be Operating Income + Interest Expense (since interest expense is a negative number, adding it would be subtracting). Wait, no: EBIT is Operating Income + Interest Expense (but interest expense is a negative number, so it's Operating Income minus Interest Expense). Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nStandard formula: EBIT = Operating Income + Interest Expense (but interest expense is a negative number, so it's Operating Income - |Interest Expense|). However, in the income statement, Operating Income is before interest and taxes. So Operating Income is already EBIT before interest. Wait, no. Let's think.\n\nOperating Income is calculated as Revenue minus COGS and operating expenses. Then, Interest Expense is subtracted to get Income Before Taxes. So Operating Income is EBIT if we consider that EBIT is before interest and taxes. Wait, no. EBIT is Earnings Before Interest and Taxes, which is the same as Operating Income. Because Operating Income is calculated before interest and taxes. So Operating Income = EBIT.\n\nYes, that's right. For example, in the income statement, Operating Income is the line before Interest Expense and Income Taxes. So Operating Income is EBIT. Therefore, the unadjusted EBIT would be the Operating Income figure.\n\nLooking at the statement, for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, Operating Income is $9,285 million. The question is asking for the year ending in 2024, which matches this line item.\n\nI should check if there's any mention of adjustments. The term \"unadjusted\" might be to distinguish from adjusted EBIT, which sometimes excludes certain items. But in this case, the Operating Income is presented as is, so it's the unadjusted figure.\n\nSo the answer should be $9,285 million. But the question says \"unadjusted EBIT,\" and since Operating Income is the standard EBIT figure, that's it.\n\nWait, let me double-check the income statement structure. The line items are:\n\n- Revenue\n- Operating Expenses (Merchandise costs, SG&A)\n- Operating Income (which is Revenue - Operating Expenses)\n- Then Other Income (Expense), including Interest Expense\n- Income Before Income Taxes\n\nSo Operating Income is indeed EBIT. Therefore, the unadjusted EBIT is $9,285 million.\n\nThe user provided the context, and the answer should be in the correct financial format. So the final answer is $9,285 million, but the question might expect it without the \"million\" part, but in the context, the numbers are in millions. The answer should be written as 9,285 (since the context says \"amounts in millions\"), but the instruction says \"in the correct financial format.\" Typically, for such answers, they might expect the number as presented in the statement, which is 9,285 (with the understanding it's in millions).\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement: \"amounts in millions, except per share data.\" So the Operating Income is $9,285 million, but when reporting the number, it's common to just state the number as 9,285 (implying millions). So the answer should be 9,285.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other line that might be considered. For example, sometimes EBIT is calculated as Net Income + Interest + Taxes. But in this case, the Operating Income is already the EBIT figure. Let's verify with the numbers.\n\nNet Income is $7,367 million. Income Before Taxes is $9,740 million. So Interest Expense is $169 million (since Income Before Taxes = Operating Income + Interest Income - Interest Expense; but in the statement, Interest Expense is listed as ($169), so it's a negative, meaning it's subtracted. So Operating Income = Income Before Taxes - Interest Income + Interest Expense. Wait, let's see:\n\nIncome Before Income Taxes = Operating Income + Interest Income (net) - Interest Expense.\n\nFrom the statement:\n\nOperating Income: 9,285\n\nOther Income (Expense):\n\nInterest expense: (169)\n\nInterest income and other, net: 624\n\nSo Interest Income and Other, Net is 624, which is positive. So the total interest-related is 624 - 169 = 455. So Income Before Taxes = Operating Income + 455 = 9,285 + 455 = 9,740, which matches the given Income Before Income Taxes of $9,740 million. Therefore, Operating Income is indeed EBIT, as it's before interest and taxes.\n\nTherefore, the unadjusted EBIT is $9,285 million, which in the context of the financial statement (amounts in millions), the answer is 9,285.\n\nSo the final answer should be 9,285.\n</think>\n\nThe unadjusted EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) corresponds to the Operating Income line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, Operating Income is reported as $9,285 million. This figure represents EBIT before any adjustments, as it is derived directly from the income statement without additional modifications.\n\n<answer>:9,285",

First, I need to recall what EBIT stands for—Earnings Before Interest and Taxes.

Wait, EBIT is typically operating income plus interest expense, but sometimes it's used interchangeably with operating income. However, adjusted EBIT might require adding back certain items.\n\nWait, the standard EBIT is operating income before interest and taxes. But in some contexts, adjusted EBIT might exclude non-operating items. Let me check the income statement again. The line items are:\n\n- Operating income: $9,285 million\n- Other income (expense): Interest expense ($169), Interest income and other, net $624\n- Income before income taxes: $9,740 million\n\nSo, EBIT would be operating income, which is $9,285 million. But sometimes \"adjusted EBIT\" might refer to adding back non-cash items like depreciation. Wait, the question says \"adjusted EBIT,\" so maybe they want EBITDA? But the question specifically says EBIT, not EBITDA.\n\nWait, looking at the income statement, operating income is already after deducting operating expenses (merchandise costs, SG&A), so operating income is EBIT. But let me confirm. EBIT is earnings before interest and taxes, so it's operating income plus interest expense. Wait, no: operating income is before interest and taxes. So EBIT is the same as operating income here. Because operating income is calculated before interest and taxes. Let me check the income statement structure.\n\nThe income statement shows:\n\n- Revenue\n- Operating expenses (merchandise costs, SG&A)\n- Operating income (which is revenue minus operating expenses)\n- Then other income/expenses (interest, etc.)\n- Income before taxes\n\nSo operating income is indeed EBIT. Therefore, the EBIT for 2024 is $9,285 million.\n\nBut the question says \"adjusted EBIT.\" Why would it be adjusted? Maybe they want to exclude certain items. Let me check if there's any note about adjustments. The context provided includes notes, but I don't see any specific adjustment mentioned for EBIT. The term \"adjusted EBIT\" might be a red herring, or perhaps in this context, it's just referring to the standard EBIT, which is operating income.\n\nLooking at the income statement, the operating income for 2024 is $9,285 million. The question is asking for the adjusted EBIT, but if there's no specific adjustment mentioned, then the answer should be the operating income figure.\n\nWait, sometimes \"adjusted EBIT\" might refer to adding back non-cash items like depreciation. But EBITDA is EBIT plus depreciation. However, the question says EBIT, not EBITDA. So probably, the answer is the operating income.\n\nLet me check the numbers again. The operating income for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024 is $9,285 million. The other income (expense) section shows interest expense of ($169), so EBIT would be operating income, which is already before interest. So EBIT = operating income = $9,285 million.\n\nThe term \"adjusted\" might be a mistake, or perhaps in the context of the problem, they just want the operating income. Since the question is from a financial context, and the term \"adjusted EBIT\" isn't standard unless specified, but given the data, the operating income is the EBIT figure.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $9,285 million. But the question says \"adjusted EBIT,\" so maybe they want to add back something. Wait, in some cases, companies adjust EBIT by adding back stock-based compensation or other non-cash items. Let me check the cash flow statement.\n\nIn the cash flow statement, under operating activities, they have \"Depreciation and amortization\" $2,237, \"Non-cash lease expense\" $315, \"Stock-based compensation\" $818. So if adjusted EBIT is EBIT plus non-cash items, but that would be EBITDA. However, the question says EBIT, not EBITDA.\n\nWait, the problem says \"adjusted EBIT,\" but in the absence of specific adjustments mentioned, the standard EBIT is operating income. So I think the answer is $9,285 million.\n\nWait, but let me check if the operating income is already adjusted. The operating income line is presented as is, so unless there's a note saying \"adjusted,\" it's just the operating income. The term \"adjusted\" might be a typo or misnomer here. Given the data provided, the correct figure for EBIT is the operating income of $9,285 million.\n\nSo the final answer should be $9,285 million. But the question says \"for the year ending in 2024,\" which matches the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, so that's the correct period.\n\nDouble-checking the income statement: Operating income is $9,285 for 2024. Yes. So adjusted EBIT is likely the same as operating income here. Therefore, the answer is $9,285 million.\n</think>\n\nThe question asks for the adjusted EBIT for the year ending in 2024. In financial statements, EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) is typically equivalent to operating income, as operating income is calculated before interest and taxes. The provided Consolidated Statements of Income show \"Operating income\" as $9,285 million for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024. The term \"adjusted EBIT\" does not indicate any specific adjustments beyond standard EBIT (i.e., operating income), as no additional adjustments are specified in the context. Therefore, the adjusted EBIT is the operating income figure.\n\n<answer>:9,285",

      "question": "Compute the unadjusted EBITDA Margin for 2024. ",
      "ground_truth": "4.53%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is to compute the unadjusted EBITDA Margin for 2024. First, I need to recall what EBITDA stands for. EBITDA is Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. So, the unadjusted EBITDA would be operating income plus depreciation and amortization.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, I need to find the operating income and the depreciation and amortization for 2024. \n\nFrom the Consolidated Statements of Income, under Operating Expenses, the Operating Income for 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024 is $9,285 million. \n\nThen, in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, under Cash Flows from Operating Activities, there's a line item for Depreciation and Amortization, which is $2,237 million for 2024. \n\nSo, EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization = $9,285 + $2,237 = $11,522 million.\n\nNext, the EBITDA Margin is EBITDA divided by Total Revenue. The Total Revenue for 2024 is $254,453 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Income, Total Revenue line).\n\nCalculating the margin: ($11,522 / $254,453) * 100. Let me do that math. \n\n11,522 divided by 254,453 equals approximately 0.04527, so 4.527%. Rounding to two decimal places, it's 4.53%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the numbers. Operating Income is $9,285 million, Depreciation and Amortization is $2,237 million. Adding them gives 9,285 + 2,237 = 11,522. Total Revenue is 254,453. So 11,522 / 254,453 = 0.04527, which is 4.53%.\n\nI should confirm if there's any other adjustment needed for \"unadjusted\" EBITDA. The term \"unadjusted\" here probably means not adjusted for things like non-cash items beyond depreciation and amortization, but in this case, the standard EBITDA calculation uses operating income plus D&A, so that's correct.\n\nLooking at the Cash Flow statement, the Depreciation and Amortization is listed as $2,237, which matches the number I need. The Operating Income is $9,285. So the calculation seems right.\n\nTotal Revenue is $254,453 million. So the margin is (11,522 / 254,453) * 100 = 4.53%.\n\nWait, let me check the exact numbers again. The Operating Income is $9,285 million, D&A is $2,237 million. Sum is 11,522. Total Revenue is $254,453. So 11,522 divided by 254,453 equals approximately 0.04527, which is 4.527%, so 4.53% when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any other adjustments needed for unadjusted EBITDA. Sometimes EBITDA might exclude other items, but the standard is operating income plus D&A. The problem specifies \"unadjusted,\" so no further adjustments.\n\nSo the final answer should be 4.53%.\n</think>\n\nTo compute the unadjusted EBITDA Margin for 2024, we use the formula:  \nEBITDA Margin = (Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization) / Total Revenue × 100  \n\nFrom the Consolidated Statements of Income:  \n- Operating Income (2024) = $9,285 million  \n- Depreciation and Amortization (from Cash Flows) = $2,237 million  \n- Total Revenue (2024) = $254,453 million  \n\nEBITDA = $9,285 + $2,237 = $11,522 million  \nEBITDA Margin = ($11,522 / $254,453) × 100 ≈ 4.53%  \n\n<answer>:4.53%",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to compute the adjusted EBITDA Margin for 2024 based on the provided financial statements for Costco. Let me recall what EBITDA is: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. Adjusted EBITDA might involve some additional adjustments, but typically for this context, it's EBITDA without the non-operating items.\n\nFirst, I need to find the EBITDA. The income statement shows:\n\n- Operating income: $9,285 million (for 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024)\n- Depreciation and amortization: $2,237 million (from the cash flow statement, under operating activities)\n\nEBITDA is usually operating income plus depreciation and amortization. So, EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation & Amortization.\n\nSo, EBITDA = $9,285 + $2,237 = $11,522 million.\n\nNow, the question is about the margin, which is EBITDA divided by Total Revenue. Total Revenue is given as $254,453 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Income: Total Revenue).\n\nSo, EBITDA Margin = (EBITDA / Total Revenue) * 100.\n\nCalculating that: $11,522 / $254,453 ≈ 0.04527, or 4.527%.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"adjusted EBITDA.\" Sometimes adjusted EBITDA might exclude other items, but in this case, the standard calculation for EBITDA margin would use the operating income plus D&A. The cash flow statement shows \"Depreciation and amortization\" as $2,237, which is the same as the D&A in the income statement (since it's a non-cash expense).\n\nLooking at the income statement, Operating Income is $9,285. The cash flow statement lists \"Depreciation and amortization\" as $2,237, which is added back to net income to get operating cash flow. So yes, EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A.\n\nTotal Revenue is $254,453 million.\n\nSo, EBITDA Margin = (9,285 + 2,237) / 254,453 = 11,522 / 254,453 ≈ 0.04527, or 4.53% when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the numbers. The income statement shows:\n\nOperating income: $9,285 million\n\nDepreciation and amortization: $2,237 million (from cash flow statement, which is consistent with the income statement's non-cash expenses).\n\nTotal Revenue: $254,453 million.\n\nSo, 11,522 / 254,453 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 11,522 ÷ 254,453 ≈ 0.04527, so 4.53%.\n\nBut I should confirm if there's any other adjustment needed for \"adjusted EBITDA.\" The problem doesn't specify any additional adjustments, so I think it's safe to use the standard EBITDA.\n\nAlso, note that the income statement has \"Operating income\" as $9,285, which is after subtracting operating expenses (merchandise costs and SG&A), so adding back D&A (which is already included in operating expenses) gives EBITDA.\n\nYes, that's correct. Operating income is EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes), so EBITDA would be EBIT + D&A.\n\nSo, EBITDA = $9,285 + $2,237 = $11,522 million.\n\nTotal Revenue = $254,453 million.\n\nMargin = (11,522 / 254,453) * 100 = 4.527%, which rounds to 4.53%.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects it as a percentage or a decimal. Typically, margins are reported as percentages, so 4.53%.\n\nWait, the problem says \"adjusted EBITDA Margin,\" but in the context of the provided data, there's no indication of additional adjustments beyond the standard EBITDA. So, I think it's safe to proceed with the standard calculation.\n\nAnother thing to check: the income statement shows \"Operating income\" as $9,285, which is correct. The cash flow statement lists \"Depreciation and amortization\" as $2,237, which matches the D&A expense.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the adjusted EBITDA Margin for 2024 is 4.53%.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the total revenue. The income statement says \"Total revenue\" is $254,453 million. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 11,522 / 254,453 = 0.04527, so 4.53%.\n\nI think that's it. The answer should be 4.53%.\n</think>\n\nTo compute the adjusted EBITDA Margin for 2024, we use the formula:  \n**EBITDA Margin = (EBITDA / Total Revenue) × 100**  \n\n- **EBITDA** = Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization  \n  - Operating Income (from Consolidated Statements of Income): $9,285 million  \n  - Depreciation and Amortization (from Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows): $2,237 million  \n  - EBITDA = $9,285 + $2,237 = **$11,522 million**  \n- **Total Revenue** (from Consolidated Statements of Income): **$254,453 million**  \n\n**EBITDA Margin** = ($11,522 / $254,453) × 100 ≈ **4.53%**  \n\n<answer>:4.53%</answer>",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking for the P/E ratio for 2024 using Basic EPS. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the P/E ratio is. The Price-to-Earnings ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the earnings per share (EPS). The question specifies using Basic EPS, so I should look for the Basic EPS figure in the provided financial statements.\n\nLooking at the original context, there's a section titled \"NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO COSTCO\" with Basic EPS listed as $16.59 for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024. That's the Basic EPS for 2024.\n\nNext, I need the stock price. The problem statement includes \"Costco Stock Price: $940\" right after the financial statements. So the current stock price is $940.\n\nNow, to calculate the P/E ratio: Stock Price / Basic EPS. So that's $940 divided by $16.59. Let me do that calculation.\n\n940 ÷ 16.59 ≈ 56.66. \n\nWait, let me check that division again. 16.59 times 56 is 16.59*50=829.5, 16.59*6=99.54, so total 829.5+99.54=929.04. Then 940 - 929.04 = 10.96. So 56 + (10.96/16.59) ≈ 56 + 0.66 ≈ 56.66. So approximately 56.66.\n\nBut I should confirm if the stock price given is the current price as of the report date. The problem states \"Costco Stock Price: $940\" without a date, but since the financials are for 2024, it's safe to assume that's the relevant price.\n\nThe question specifies \"using Basic EPS,\" and the Basic EPS for 2024 is $16.59. So the calculation is straightforward.\n\nDouble-checking the numbers: Stock price $940, Basic EPS $16.59. 940 / 16.59 ≈ 56.66. Typically, P/E ratios are rounded to two decimal places, so 56.66.\n\nWait, but sometimes they might round to one decimal. Let me see. 940 divided by 16.59. Let me use a calculator for precision. 16.59 * 56.66 = 16.59*50=829.5, 16.59*6=99.54, 16.59*0.66≈10.95, so total 829.5+99.54=929.04 +10.95≈939.99, which is about 940. So yes, 56.66 is correct.\n\nSo the P/E ratio is approximately 56.66. The problem says to provide the answer in the correct financial format, which is usually two decimal places for P/E ratios.\n\nI should make sure there's no trick here. The question says \"for 2024,\" and the Basic EPS given is for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, which is the 2024 fiscal year. The stock price is provided as $940, so that's the market price at the time of the report. So the calculation is correct.\n\nNo other information seems relevant here. The other data like Beta, Cost of Debt, etc., are probably distractors for this specific question. The question is straightforward once you have the stock price and Basic EPS.\n\nSo the final answer should be 56.66.\n</think>\n\nThe P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by the Basic EPS. The stock price is given as $940, and the Basic EPS for 2024 is $16.59.  \nP/E = $940 / $16.59 ≈ 56.66.\n\n<answer>:56.66",

The question specifies using Diluted EPS, so I should look for that in the financial statements.\n\nLooking at the provided context, there's a section titled \"NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO COSTCO\" with both Basic and Diluted EPS. For 2024, the Diluted EPS is listed as $16.56. \n\nNow, I need the market price per share for Costco as of the end of 2024. The context mentions \"Costco Stock Price: $940\" under the given data. So, the market price is $940.\n\nTo calculate the P/E ratio: Market Price / Diluted EPS = 940 / 16.56. Let me do that division. \n\n940 divided by 16.56. Let me compute that. 16.56 times 56 is about 927.36, so 940 - 927.36 = 12.64. So approximately 56.7. Let me check with a calculator: 940 ÷ 16.56 ≈ 56.76. Rounding to two decimal places, it's about 56.76. But financial ratios are often reported to two decimal places, so 56.76.\n\nWait, but sometimes P/E ratios are rounded to two decimal places. Let me confirm the numbers again. The Diluted EPS for 2024 is $16.56, and the stock price is $940. So 940 / 16.56 = 56.76. \n\nI should check if there's any other information that might affect this. The context also includes other data like Beta, Cost of Debt, etc., but those aren't relevant for the P/E ratio calculation. The key numbers are the stock price and the Diluted EPS.\n\nSo the calculation seems straightforward. The answer should be 940 divided by 16.56, which equals approximately 56.76. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the years. The question is for 2024, and the Diluted EPS provided is for 2024 (the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024). The stock price is given as $940, which I assume is the closing price for the period ending 2024. \n\nYes, so the numbers are correct. Therefore, the P/E ratio is 56.76.\n</think>\n\nThe P/E ratio is calculated as the market price per share divided by the Diluted EPS. The market price for Costco is given as $940, and the Diluted EPS for 2024 is $16.56. \n\nP/E ratio = $940 / $16.56 ≈ 56.76\n\n<answer>:56.76",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking for the Diluted EPS of Costco and to manually calculate the fully diluted shares outstanding. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Diluted EPS is. It's the earnings per share after accounting for all dilutive securities, like stock options, warrants, and convertible bonds. But in this case, the context provided includes the Consolidated Statements of Income, which already lists the Diluted EPS as $16.56 for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024. However, the question says to manually calculate the fully diluted shares outstanding, so I can't just take the given Diluted EPS. I need to compute it from the net income and the shares used in the calculation.\n\nLooking at the Consolidated Statements of Income, under \"NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO COSTCO,\" it shows Diluted EPS as $16.56. The shares used in the calculation for Diluted are listed as 444,759 (in thousands). Wait, the note says \"Shares used in calculation (000’s)\" and for Diluted it's 444,759. So that's 444,759,000 shares.\n\nBut the question is to manually calculate the fully diluted shares outstanding. The given Diluted EPS is $16.56, and the Net Income Attributable to Costco is $7,367 million. So, to find the shares, I should divide the net income by the Diluted EPS. Wait, but the problem says to calculate the shares, not the EPS. Wait, the question says \"What is the Diluted EPS... Manually calculate fully diluted shares outstanding.\"\n\nWait, the Diluted EPS is already given as $16.56. But maybe they want me to verify it by calculating the shares. Let me check the numbers.\n\nNet Income Attributable to Costco: $7,367 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Income).\n\nDiluted EPS: $16.56.\n\nSo, Shares Outstanding (Diluted) = Net Income / Diluted EPS.\n\nCalculating that: 7,367 / 16.56 ≈ 444.759 million shares. Which matches the 444,759 (thousand) shares listed. So the fully diluted shares outstanding is 444,759,000 shares.\n\nBut the question is asking for the Diluted EPS, which is already provided as $16.56. However, the instruction says to manually calculate the fully diluted shares. Wait, the question says \"What is the Diluted EPS... Manually calculate fully diluted shares outstanding.\" So maybe they want the EPS, but to confirm by calculating the shares. But the EPS is given, so the answer should be $16.56.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem states \"Manually calculate fully diluted shares outstanding.\" So perhaps they want the number of shares, not the EPS. But the question starts with \"What is the Diluted EPS...\" so the main answer is the EPS, but they want to see the calculation of the shares as part of the process.\n\nLooking back at the context, the Diluted EPS is already provided as $16.56. The shares used in calculation for Diluted are 444,759 (in thousands), which is 444,759,000 shares. So the Diluted EPS is calculated as Net Income / Diluted Shares = 7,367,000,000 / 444,759,000 ≈ 16.56.\n\nTherefore, the Diluted EPS is $16.56. The manual calculation of shares is just confirming that the given EPS is correct based on the provided numbers.\n\nSo the final answer should be $16.56. The question says to provide the Diluted EPS, so even though they asked to calculate the shares, the answer they want is the EPS value.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other information needed. The context includes stock-based compensation, which might affect the diluted shares. But the Consolidated Statements of Income already provide the Diluted Shares as 444,759 (thousand), so that's the number to use. The note about RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) might be part of the dilution, but since the company already reports the diluted shares, we don't need to adjust it further. The problem says \"manually calculate fully diluted shares outstanding,\" but the data is provided in the financial statements, so the calculation is just using the given numbers.\n\nSo, the Diluted EPS is $16.56, and the fully diluted shares are 444,759,000. But the question asks for the Diluted EPS, so the answer is $16.56.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"What is the Diluted EPS of Costco? Manually calculate fully diluted shares outstanding.\" So the main answer is the EPS, and the calculation of shares is part of the reasoning. But the final answer should be the EPS.\n\nLooking at the provided data, the Diluted EPS is explicitly listed as $16.56. So the answer is $16.56. The manual calculation of shares would be 7,367 / 16.56 ≈ 444.759 million, which matches the 444,759 (thousand) shares. So the EPS is confirmed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $16.56.\n</think>\n\nThe Diluted EPS is provided directly in the Consolidated Statements of Income as $16.56 for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024. To manually verify, the fully diluted shares outstanding are given as 444,759 (in thousands) in the \"Shares used in calculation\" section. The calculation is:\n\nNet Income Attributable to Costco: $7,367 million  \nDiluted Shares Outstanding: 444,759,000 shares  \n\nDiluted EPS = $7,367,000,000 / 444,759,000 = $16.56  \n\nThis confirms the reported Diluted EPS.\n\n<answer>:16.56",

      "question": "Determine the EV/EBITDA ratio for 2024. Make sure to adjust for EBITDA and use the market value of equity to estimate enterprise value. Make sure to hand calculated fully diluted shares outstanding. Assume the only non-operating asset is excess cash.",
      "ground_truth": "35.44x",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this EV/EBITDA calculation for Costco for 2024. First, I need to recall that EV/EBITDA is Enterprise Value divided by EBITDA. The question specifies to adjust for EBITDA and use market value of equity for enterprise value, with excess cash as the only non-operating asset.\n\nStarting with EBITDA. From the income statement, operating income is $9,285 million. But EBITDA is operating income plus depreciation and amortization. Looking at the cash flow statement, depreciation and amortization is $2,237 million. So EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation & Amortization = $9,285 + $2,237 = $11,522 million.\n\nWait, but I should confirm if there are any other adjustments needed. The problem says \"adjust for EBITDA,\" but I think the standard adjustment is adding back D&A to operating income. The cash flow statement shows D&A as $2,237, so that should be correct.\n\nNext, Enterprise Value (EV). The formula is Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash. But the problem states to use market value of equity to estimate EV, and assume excess cash is the only non-operating asset. So EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash.\n\nFirst, market value of equity. The stock price is given as $940. Shares outstanding: the diluted shares are 444,759,000 (from the income statement, diluted shares used in calculation). So Market Cap = $940 * 444,759,000. Let me calculate that: 940 * 444,759,000 = $417,073,460,000, which is $417,073.46 million.\n\nDebt: From the balance sheet, total debt includes current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt. Current portion is $103 million, long-term debt excluding current portion is $5,794 million. So total debt = $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million. Wait, but in the balance sheet, total liabilities include current liabilities and long-term liabilities. The current portion of long-term debt is $103, and long-term debt excluding current portion is $5,794. So total debt is $5,897 million.\n\nCash: The balance sheet shows Cash and cash equivalents as $9,906 million. The problem says \"excess cash\" is the only non-operating asset, so we subtract that.\n\nSo EV = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash = $417,073.46 + $5,897 - $9,906 = $417,073.46 + 5,897 = $422,970.46; then minus $9,906 = $413,064.46 million.\n\nWait, let me double-check the debt. The balance sheet lists \"Current portion of long-term debt\" as $103 million, and \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" as $5,794 million. So total debt is $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million. That seems right.\n\nNow, EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash. Market Cap is $940 * 444,759,000. Let's compute that exactly: 940 * 444,759 = 940 * 444,759. Let's do 900*444,759 = 400,283,100; 40*444,759 = 17,790,360; total 418,073,460. So $418,073.46 million. Wait, earlier I had $417,073, but that was a miscalculation. 940 * 444,759 = let's compute 444,759 * 900 = 400,283,100; 444,759 * 40 = 17,790,360; sum is 418,073,460. So $418,073.46 million.\n\nThen EV = 418,073.46 + 5,897 - 9,906 = 418,073.46 + 5,897 = 423,970.46; minus 9,906 = 414,064.46 million.\n\nNow, EBITDA is $11,522 million as calculated.\n\nSo EV/EBITDA = 414,064.46 / 11,522 ≈ 35.94.\n\nWait, but let me confirm EBITDA again. Operating income is $9,285 million. Depreciation and amortization is $2,237 million (from cash flow statement). So EBITDA = 9,285 + 2,237 = 11,522. That's correct.\n\nNow, the problem says \"hand calculated fully diluted shares outstanding.\" The diluted shares are 444,759,000, which is 444.759 million. So market cap is 940 * 444.759 = 418,073.46 million. Correct.\n\nDebt: Total debt is current portion + long-term debt = 103 + 5,794 = 5,897 million. Cash is 9,906 million.\n\nEV = 418,073.46 + 5,897 - 9,906 = 418,073.46 - 3,999 = 414,074.46? Wait, 5,897 - 9,906 = -4,009. So 418,073.46 - 4,009 = 414,064.46 million. Yes.\n\nSo EV/EBITDA = 414,064.46 / 11,522 ≈ 35.94.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other adjustment. The problem mentions \"adjust for EBITDA,\" but I think the standard is to add back D&A to operating income. Sometimes EBITDA is calculated as net income + interest + taxes + D&A, but here operating income is given, so adding D&A is correct.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"use market value of equity to estimate enterprise value,\" which we did by using market cap (market value of equity) plus debt minus cash.\n\nAnother thing: the balance sheet shows \"Short-term investments\" as $1,238 million, but the problem says \"assume the only non-operating asset is excess cash.\" So excess cash is cash and cash equivalents, which is $9,906 million. Short-term investments might be considered part of cash for this purpose, but the problem specifies \"excess cash,\" so probably just cash and cash equivalents. The problem says \"excess cash,\" so we'll use cash and cash equivalents as the non-operating asset to subtract.\n\nSo EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash (and cash equivalents).\n\nYes, that's standard.\n\nNow, let's compute the numbers again to be precise.\n\nMarket Cap: 940 * 444,759,000 = 940 * 444.759 million = 418,073.46 million.\n\nDebt: Current portion of long-term debt $103 million + long-term debt $5,794 million = $5,897 million.\n\nCash: $9,906 million.\n\nEV = 418,073.46 + 5,897 - 9,906 = 418,073.46 - 4,009 = 414,064.46 million.\n\nEBITDA: Operating income $9,285 + D&A $2,237 = $11,522 million.\n\nEV/EBITDA = 414,064.46 / 11,522 ≈ 35.94.\n\nRounded to two decimal places, it's 35.94.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects rounding to two decimals or maybe one. Typically, EV/EBITDA is reported to two decimals.\n\nWait, the problem says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" So probably 35.94.\n\nBut let me confirm the EBITDA calculation once more. The income statement shows operating income as $9,285 million. The cash flow statement shows depreciation and amortization as $2,237 million. So EBITDA is operating income plus D&A, which is $11,522 million. Correct.\n\nAnother point: the problem says \"adjust for EBITDA.\" Is there any other adjustment? For example, sometimes non-recurring items are adjusted, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I think it's straightforward.\n\nAlso, the diluted shares are given as 444,759,000 (from the income statement: \"Diluted 444,759\" in thousands, so 444,759,000 shares). So market cap is correct.\n\nSo the ratio is approximately 35.94.\n\nWait, let me do the division: 414,064.46 / 11,522.\n\nCalculate 11,522 * 35 = 403,270.\n\n414,064.46 - 403,270 = 10,794.46.\n\n10,794.46 / 11,522 ≈ 0.937.\n\nSo 35 + 0.937 = 35.937, which rounds to 35.94.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final answer should be 35.94.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the EV/EBITDA ratio for 2024:\n\n1. **EBITDA Calculation**:\n   - Operating income (from income statement): $9,285 million\n   - Add back depreciation and amortization (from cash flow statement): $2,237 million\n   - EBITDA = $9,285 + $2,237 = **$11,522 million**\n\n2. **Enterprise Value (EV) Calculation**:\n   - Market value of equity = Stock price × Diluted shares outstanding\n     - Stock price: $940\n     - Diluted shares: 444,759,000 (from income statement)\n     - Market cap = $940 × 444,759,000 = **$418,073.46 million**\n   - Total debt = Current portion of long-term debt + Long-term debt excluding current portion\n     - Current portion: $103 million\n     - Long-term debt: $5,794 million\n     - Total debt = $103 + $5,794 = **$5,897 million**\n   - Cash (excess cash, only non-operating asset): $9,906 million\n   - EV = Market cap + Total debt - Cash\n     - EV = $418,073.46 + $5,897 - $9,906 = **$414,064.46 million**\n\n3. **EV/EBITDA Ratio**:\n   - EV/EBITDA = $414,064.46 / $11,522 ≈ **35.94**\n\n<answer>:35.94",

      "ground_truth": "$424,216 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this Enterprise Value calculation for Costco. The question asks for Enterprise Value for 2024 using market value of equity, with fully diluted shares outstanding, and assuming excess cash is the only non-operating asset.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the Enterprise Value formula: \nEV = Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash\n\nBut let me verify the components from the provided financials.\n\nMarket Value of Equity: This would be the current stock price multiplied by fully diluted shares outstanding. The problem states the stock price is $940. Now I need the fully diluted shares.\n\nLooking at the income statement, it shows \"Diluted\" shares used in calculation as 444,759 (in thousands). The note says \"Shares used in calculation (000’s)\" with diluted at 444,759. So fully diluted shares = 444,759,000.\n\nWait, but there's also a note about RSUs. The balance sheet shows common stock shares issued and outstanding as 443,126,000. But for diluted shares, the income statement shows 444,759,000. The RSU activity shows 908,000 RSUs vested but not delivered, which would be part of the diluted shares. So the 444,759,000 should be the correct fully diluted shares.\n\nSo Market Value of Equity = $940 * 444,759,000 = let's calculate that.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"hand calculated fully diluted shares outstanding\" - so I should confirm if the 444,759 is already the fully diluted number. The income statement shows \"Diluted\" shares as 444,759 (in thousands), so yes, that's the fully diluted shares.\n\nNow, Debt: From the balance sheet, total debt includes current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt. The balance sheet shows:\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\nSo total debt = $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million\n\nBut wait, the balance sheet lists \"Total Liabilities\" as $46,209 million, but that includes all liabilities. For EV, we need only debt (not all liabilities). The debt components are:\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794\nSo total debt = $5,897 million\n\nCash: The balance sheet shows \"Cash and cash equivalents\" as $9,906 million. The problem states \"assume the only non-operating asset is excess cash,\" so we'll use this cash figure.\n\nNow, Enterprise Value = Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nMarket Value of Equity = $940 * 444,759,000 = $940 * 444.759 million = let's calculate:\n444.759 * 940 = 444.759 * 900 + 444.759 * 40 = 400,283.1 + 17,790.36 = $418,073.46 million\n\nDebt = $5,897 million (as calculated above)\n\nCash = $9,906 million\n\nSo EV = 418,073.46 + 5,897 - 9,906 = 418,073.46 - 3,999 = $414,074.46 million\n\nWait, let me double-check the debt. The balance sheet shows:\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794\nTotal debt = $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million. That seems correct.\n\nBut looking at the balance sheet, there's also \"Other long-term liabilities\" which includes things like deferred tax liabilities, but for EV calculation, we only consider interest-bearing debt. The problem states \"assume the only non-operating asset is excess cash,\" so we should only subtract cash, not other assets.\n\nAlso, note that the balance sheet shows \"Short-term investments\" as $1,238 million, but the problem says \"excess cash\" is the only non-operating asset. Typically, cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments, but the problem specifies \"excess cash,\" so I think we should use only cash and cash equivalents ($9,906 million) and not include short-term investments. The problem says \"excess cash,\" so probably just the cash and cash equivalents line.\n\nConfirming the balance sheet:\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $9,906 million\n- Short-term investments: $1,238 million\n\nBut the problem states \"assume the only non-operating asset is excess cash,\" so I think we should treat cash and cash equivalents as the excess cash, and short-term investments might be considered part of operating assets. However, in standard EV calculation, we subtract all cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments. But the problem specifically says \"excess cash,\" so perhaps they mean cash and cash equivalents only. To be safe, I'll use cash and cash equivalents as $9,906 million.\n\nNow, let's recalculate:\n\nMarket Value of Equity = $940 * 444,759,000 = $418,073,460,000 = $418,073.46 million\n\nDebt = $5,897 million\n\nCash = $9,906 million\n\nEV = 418,073.46 + 5,897 - 9,906 = 418,073.46 - 3,999 = $414,074.46 million\n\nBut let's do the math precisely:\n\n418,073.46 + 5,897 = 423,970.46\n\n423,970.46 - 9,906 = 414,064.46 million\n\nWait, 423,970.46 - 9,906 = 414,064.46 million\n\nBut let me check the multiplication again:\n\n444,759,000 shares * $940/share\n\n= 444,759 * 940 * 1,000 (since shares are in thousands)\n\n444,759 * 940:\n\n400,000 * 940 = 376,000,000\n\n44,759 * 940 = let's compute 44,000*940 = 41,360,000; 759*940 = 713,460; total 42,073,460\n\nSo total = 376,000,000 + 42,073,460 = 418,073,460\n\nSo $418,073.46 million\n\nDebt: $5,897 million\n\nCash: $9,906 million\n\nEV = 418,073.46 + 5,897 - 9,906 = 418,073.46 - 3,999 = 414,074.46? Wait, no:\n\n418,073.46 + 5,897 = 423,970.46\n\n423,970.46 - 9,906 = 414,064.46 million\n\nYes, 423,970.46 - 9,906 = 414,064.46\n\nSo approximately $414,064 million\n\nBut let's confirm if the debt is correctly calculated. The balance sheet shows:\n\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\n\nTotal debt = $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million. That's correct.\n\nNow, is there any other debt? The balance sheet shows \"Other long-term liabilities\" but that's not debt. The debt is specifically listed as current portion and long-term debt.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"assume the only non-operating asset is excess cash,\" so we don't need to adjust for other non-operating assets.\n\nAnother thing: the balance sheet shows \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" but for EV, we don't include operating leases in debt; they're treated as a separate liability. But the problem says \"assume the only non-operating asset is excess cash,\" so we're not considering operating leases as part of debt or non-operating assets. So our calculation should be fine.\n\nNow, the fully diluted shares: the income statement shows \"Diluted\" shares as 444,759 (in thousands), which is 444,759,000 shares. The balance sheet shows common stock shares issued and outstanding as 443,126,000, but diluted shares should include potential shares from options and RSUs, which is given as 444,759,000. So that's correct.\n\nSo EV = $414,064.46 million\n\nBut let's round to the nearest million as is standard in financial reporting.\n\n$414,064 million\n\nWait, but let's check if the stock price is $940 per share. The problem states \"Costco Stock Price: $940\", so yes.\n\nAnother point: the problem says \"hand calculated fully diluted shares outstanding.\" The income statement shows diluted shares as 444,759 (in thousands), so that's the number to use.\n\nSo final EV = $414,064 million\n\nBut let me confirm the calculation once more:\n\nMarket Cap = 444,759,000 * 940 = 418,073,460,000 = $418,073.46 million\n\nDebt = $5,897 million\n\nCash = $9,906 million\n\nEV = 418,073.46 + 5,897 - 9,906 = 418,073.46 - 3,999 = 414,074.46? Wait, no:\n\n418,073.46 + 5,897 = 423,970.46\n\n423,970.46 - 9,906 = 414,064.46\n\nYes, $414,064.46 million, so $414,064 million when rounded to the nearest million.\n\nBut in financial contexts, it's often reported in millions without decimals, so $414,064 million.\n\nWait, but let's check if the debt should include the current portion. Yes, because current portion of long-term debt is part of total debt.\n\nAlso, the balance sheet shows \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" as $5,794, and current portion as $103, so total debt is $5,897. Correct.\n\nAnother thing: the problem says \"market value of equity\" which is the market cap, so we're using the stock price times shares.\n\nI think that's all. So the final answer should be $414,064 million.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate Enterprise Value (EV) for Costco in 2024, the formula is:  \n**EV = Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash**  \n\n- **Market Value of Equity**:  \n  - Stock price = $940  \n  - Fully diluted shares outstanding (from income statement) = 444,759,000 shares  \n  - Market Value = $940 × 444,759,000 = **$418,073.46 million**  \n\n- **Debt**:  \n  - Current portion of long-term debt = $103 million  \n  - Long-term debt (excluding current portion) = $5,794 million  \n  - Total Debt = $103 + $5,794 = **$5,897 million**  \n\n- **Cash**:  \n  - Cash and cash equivalents (only non-operating asset) = **$9,906 million**  \n\n**EV Calculation**:  \n$418,073.46 million (Market Value) + $5,897 million (Debt) - $9,906 million (Cash) = **$414,064.46 million**  \n\nRounded to the nearest million: **$414,064 million**.  \n\n<answer>:414064",

      "question": "What is the Equity Value in 2024? Assume Enterprise Value is 420 Billion and assume the only non-operating asset not factored into Enterprise Value is excess cash.",
      "ground_truth": "$414,640 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking for the Equity Value in 2024 for Costco. The given information states that Enterprise Value is $420 billion, and the only non-operating asset not factored into Enterprise Value is excess cash.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationship between Enterprise Value (EV), Equity Value, and other components. The basic formula is:\n\nEnterprise Value = Equity Value + Debt - Cash\n\nBut wait, sometimes it's presented as:\n\nEV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash\n\nWhere Market Cap is the Equity Value. So rearranging that, Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nThe problem states that Enterprise Value is $420 billion. Now, I need to find the Debt and Cash values from the provided financial statements.\n\nLooking at the Consolidated Balance Sheets for September 1, 2024 (the latest date given):\n\n- Total Liabilities: $46,209 million (which is $46.209 billion)\n- But Debt specifically: The Long-term debt, excluding current portion is $5,794 million, and the current portion of long-term debt is $103 million. So total debt would be $5,794 + $103 = $5,897 million, which is $5.897 billion.\n\nWait, but in the Balance Sheet, under Current Liabilities, there's \"Current portion of long-term debt\" of $103 million. And under Other Liabilities, \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" is $5,794 million. So total debt is $5,794 + $103 = $5,897 million, or $5.897 billion.\n\nNow, Cash and cash equivalents as of September 1, 2024, is $9,906 million, which is $9.906 billion.\n\nBut the problem says \"excess cash\" is the only non-operating asset not factored into Enterprise Value. So Enterprise Value typically includes all operating assets and liabilities, but excludes cash and non-operating assets. Wait, no: Enterprise Value is usually calculated as Market Cap + Debt - Cash. So the Enterprise Value already factors in the debt and subtracts cash. But the problem states that the only non-operating asset not factored into EV is excess cash. So that means that the EV of $420 billion already excludes the excess cash. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"assume the only non-operating asset not factored into Enterprise Value is excess cash.\" So Enterprise Value is calculated without considering excess cash. But in standard terms, EV = Equity Value + Debt - Cash. So if EV is given as 420 billion, and we need to find Equity Value, then Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nBut the problem states that the excess cash is the only non-operating asset not factored into EV. So that means that the EV of 420 billion does not include the excess cash. Wait, but in standard EV calculation, cash is subtracted. So if EV is given as 420 billion, which is already adjusted for cash (i.e., EV = Equity Value + Debt - Cash), then to get Equity Value, it's EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nBut the problem says \"the only non-operating asset not factored into Enterprise Value is excess cash.\" So Enterprise Value does not include excess cash. Wait, but Enterprise Value typically excludes cash. So perhaps the EV provided is already calculated as Equity Value + Debt - Cash. So to get Equity Value, it's EV + Cash - Debt.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nStandard formula: EV = Market Cap (Equity Value) + Debt - Cash\n\nTherefore, Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash\n\nGiven EV = 420 billion\n\nDebt = total debt (current + long-term) = $5,897 million = $5.897 billion\n\nCash = $9,906 million = $9.906 billion\n\nSo Equity Value = 420 - 5.897 + 9.906 = 420 + (9.906 - 5.897) = 420 + 4.009 = 424.009 billion\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"excess cash\" is the only non-operating asset not factored into EV. So maybe the EV is calculated without subtracting cash, but the problem states that the EV is 420 billion, which already factors in the debt but not the cash. Wait, no. The standard EV formula subtracts cash. So if EV is given as 420 billion, then it's already EV = Equity Value + Debt - Cash. So Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nBut let's check the numbers. The cash on the balance sheet is $9,906 million. The debt is $5,897 million. So Equity Value = 420,000 - 5,897 + 9,906 = 420,000 + 4,009 = 424,009 million, which is $424.009 billion.\n\nBut the problem says \"excess cash\" is the only non-operating asset not factored into EV. So perhaps the EV is calculated without considering the excess cash, meaning that the EV of 420 billion is before adding back the excess cash. Wait, no. Let's read the problem again: \"assume the only non-operating asset not factored into Enterprise Value is excess cash.\" So Enterprise Value does not include excess cash. But in standard terms, EV is calculated as Equity Value + Debt - Cash. So if EV is given, then to get Equity Value, you need to add back Cash and subtract Debt. Wait, no: EV = Equity Value + Debt - Cash. So Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nYes, that's correct. So if EV is 420 billion, Debt is 5.897 billion, Cash is 9.906 billion, then Equity Value = 420 - 5.897 + 9.906 = 424.009 billion.\n\nBut let's confirm the debt. The balance sheet shows:\n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\n\nTotal debt: 103 + 5,794 = 5,897 million, which is $5.897 billion.\n\nCash and cash equivalents: $9,906 million, which is $9.906 billion.\n\nSo plugging into the formula:\n\nEquity Value = EV - Debt + Cash = 420 - 5.897 + 9.906 = 424.009 billion.\n\nRounding to the nearest billion, it's $424 billion.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"excess cash\" is the only non-operating asset not factored into EV. So maybe the EV is calculated without subtracting cash, but that's not standard. Wait, no. The standard EV calculation subtracts cash. So if the EV is given as 420 billion, it's already EV = Equity Value + Debt - Cash. Therefore, Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the calculation should be 420 - 5.897 + 9.906 = 424.009, so approximately $424 billion.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other non-operating assets. The problem states that the only non-operating asset not factored into EV is excess cash, so we don't have to worry about other assets like investments or something else. The balance sheet shows Short-term investments of $1,238 million, but the problem says \"excess cash\" is the only non-operating asset not factored into EV. So perhaps the short-term investments are considered part of operating assets, or maybe they're included in cash. Wait, Cash and cash equivalents is $9,906 million, and Short-term investments is $1,238 million. But the problem says \"excess cash\" is the only non-operating asset not factored into EV. So maybe the short-term investments are part of the operating assets, or perhaps the problem is considering only cash as the non-operating asset. The problem states \"excess cash,\" so maybe the short-term investments are not considered excess cash. But the problem says \"the only non-operating asset not factored into Enterprise Value is excess cash,\" so we should only consider cash as the non-operating asset. So the cash on the balance sheet is the excess cash.\n\nTherefore, using Cash = $9,906 million.\n\nSo the calculation is correct.\n\nThus, Equity Value = 420 - 5.897 + 9.906 = 424.009 billion, which rounds to $424 billion.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Enterprise Value is 420 Billion\". So 420 billion is the EV. So the answer should be $424 billion.\n\nBut let's check the numbers again. 420 billion minus debt (5.897 billion) plus cash (9.906 billion) equals 420 -5.897 = 414.103; 414.103 +9.906 = 424.009 billion. Yes.\n\nSo the final answer should be $424 billion.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate Equity Value in 2024, use the formula:  \n**Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Debt + Cash**  \n\nGiven:  \n- Enterprise Value = $420 billion  \n- Debt (current portion + long-term debt) = $103 million + $5,794 million = **$5.897 billion**  \n- Cash and cash equivalents = **$9.906 billion**  \n\nCalculation:  \nEquity Value = $420 billion - $5.897 billion + $9.906 billion = **$424.009 billion**  \n\nRounded to the nearest billion: **$424 billion**.  \n\n<answer>:424 billion",

      "question": "Compute the Market Value of Equity for 2024. Manually calculate fully diluted shares outstanding.",
      "ground_truth": "$418,856 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is to compute the Market Value of Equity for 2024, and manually calculate fully diluted shares outstanding.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that Market Value of Equity is typically calculated as the share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. But the problem specifies \"fully diluted shares outstanding,\" so I need to make sure I'm using the diluted shares, not the basic ones.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, under the Consolidated Statements of Income, there's a section for Shares used in calculation (000's). For 2024, the diluted shares are 444,759 (in thousands). Wait, the numbers are in thousands, so 444,759,000 shares? But let me confirm.\n\nThe table shows \"Diluted 444,759\" under Shares used in calculation (000's). So that's 444,759 thousand shares, which is 444,759,000 shares.\n\nNow, the problem mentions \"Costco Stock Price: $940\" in the context. So the share price is $940.\n\nMarket Value of Equity = Share Price × Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding.\n\nSo, 940 × 444,759,000. Wait, but the shares are in thousands, so 444,759 (thousand) = 444,759,000 shares.\n\nCalculating that: 940 × 444,759,000. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 940 × 444,759 = ?\n\nBut maybe it's easier to do 940 × 444.759 million (since 444,759 thousand is 444.759 million).\n\nWait, 444,759 thousand shares = 444.759 million shares.\n\nSo 940 × 444.759 million = ?\n\n940 × 444.759 = let's calculate:\n\n900 × 444.759 = 400,283.1\n\n40 × 444.759 = 17,790.36\n\nTotal = 400,283.1 + 17,790.36 = 418,073.46\n\nSo approximately 418,073.46 million dollars, which is $418,073,460,000.\n\nBut the problem says \"fully diluted shares outstanding\" and the diluted shares are 444,759 (thousand), so 444,759,000 shares.\n\nMultiply by $940: 444,759,000 × 940.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n444,759,000 × 900 = 400,283,100,000\n\n444,759,000 × 40 = 17,790,360,000\n\nTotal = 400,283,100,000 + 17,790,360,000 = 418,073,460,000\n\nSo $418,073,460,000. But typically, market cap is reported in billions, so $418.07 billion.\n\nBut the problem says \"in the correct financial format.\" So probably as $418.07 billion or $418,073 million.\n\nWait, looking at the context, the company's total assets are in millions, so maybe they expect the answer in millions. Let's check.\n\nThe shares are in thousands, so 444,759 thousand shares. So 444,759,000 shares.\n\nShare price $940.\n\nMarket Value = 444,759,000 × 940 = 418,073,460,000.\n\nExpressed in millions, that's 418,073.46 million.\n\nBut the problem says \"Market Value of Equity,\" which is usually the market capitalization, so it's common to present it in billions. However, the instructions say \"in the correct financial format,\" so perhaps as $418.07 billion.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other consideration. The problem mentions \"manually calculate fully diluted shares outstanding.\" The diluted shares are given as 444,759 (thousand), so that's the number to use. The context also provides the stock price as $940.\n\nWait, the note says \"Costco Stock Price: $940\" so that's the current price.\n\nSo the calculation is straightforward: 444,759 (thousand shares) × $940.\n\nBut 444,759 thousand shares is 444,759,000 shares.\n\n444,759,000 × 940 = 418,073,460,000.\n\nSo $418,073,460,000. To express this in a standard financial format, it's often rounded to the nearest million or billion. Since the problem doesn't specify rounding, but in financial contexts, it's common to use billions.\n\n$418.07 billion.\n\nBut let's confirm the number of shares. The Consolidated Statements of Income show \"Diluted 444,759\" under Shares used in calculation (000's). So yes, 444,759 thousand shares.\n\nSo 444,759 × 1,000 = 444,759,000 shares.\n\nMultiply by $940: 444,759,000 × 940.\n\nLet me compute 444,759 × 940 first, then add the three zeros (since it's thousands).\n\n444,759 × 940:\n\n444,759 × 900 = 400,283,100\n\n444,759 × 40 = 17,790,360\n\nTotal = 400,283,100 + 17,790,360 = 418,073,460\n\nThen, since it's in thousands of shares, multiply by 1,000: 418,073,460 × 1,000 = 418,073,460,000.\n\nSo $418,073,460,000.\n\nIn financial reporting, this is often written as $418.07 billion, but the problem might expect the exact number in millions or as a number.\n\nWait, the context has amounts in millions (e.g., \"amounts in millions, except per share data\"). So the market value should be in millions.\n\nSo $418,073.46 million.\n\nBut typically, market cap is presented in billions. However, the problem says \"in the correct financial format,\" so perhaps as $418.07 billion.\n\nBut let's check the exact numbers. The diluted shares are 444,759 (thousand), so 444.759 million shares.\n\n444.759 million shares × $940 = 444.759 × 940 = 418,073.46 million.\n\nSo $418,073.46 million.\n\nBut the problem might want it rounded to the nearest million, so $418,073 million.\n\nAlternatively, since the stock price is given as $940 (a whole number), and shares are 444,759 thousand, the exact calculation is 444,759 × 940 = 418,073,460 (thousand dollars), which is $418,073.46 million.\n\nBut in financial contexts, it's common to write it as $418.07 billion.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Market Value of Equity,\" which is the market capitalization. The standard way to present this is in billions, so $418.07 billion.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other factor. The problem mentions \"fully diluted shares outstanding,\" and the diluted shares are given, so no need to adjust for anything else. The note about stock-based compensation and RSUs might be a red herring, but the diluted shares are already provided in the income statement.\n\nSo the answer should be $418.07 billion.\n\nWait, but let's confirm the number. 444,759 thousand shares × $940 = 444,759 × 940 = 418,073,460 thousand dollars = $418,073.46 million = $418.07346 billion.\n\nRounded to two decimal places, $418.07 billion.\n\nYes, that's standard.\n\nSo the final answer should be $418.07 billion.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:418.07 billion",

      "question": "Calculate WACC for 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "9.56%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to calculate the WACC for Costco for 2024 based on the provided financial data. Let me recall that WACC stands for Weighted Average Cost of Capital, which is calculated as:\n\nWACC = (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rd * (1 - Tc)\n\nWhere:\n- E = market value of equity\n- D = market value of debt\n- V = E + D (total value of the firm)\n- Re = cost of equity\n- Rd = cost of debt\n- Tc = corporate tax rate\n\nFirst, I need to gather all the necessary components from the provided financial statements and additional information.\n\nStarting with the cost of equity (Re). The problem gives me:\n- Beta: 0.79\n- 10Y Treasury: 4.617%\n- Assume Market Return is 11%\n\nSo, using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):\nRe = Risk-free rate + Beta * (Market return - Risk-free rate)\nRe = 4.617% + 0.79 * (11% - 4.617%)\nLet me calculate that:\n11% - 4.617% = 6.383%\n0.79 * 6.383% = 5.04257%\nSo Re = 4.617% + 5.04257% = 9.65957% ≈ 9.66%\n\nNext, cost of debt (Rd) is given as 6%.\n\nNow, I need the corporate tax rate (Tc). From the financial statements, I can find the tax rate. The income tax provision for 2024 is $2,373 million, and income before taxes is $9,740 million. So:\nTax rate = Tax provision / Income before taxes = 2,373 / 9,740 ≈ 0.2436 or 24.36%\n\nNow, for the market values of equity (E) and debt (D).\n\nMarket value of equity (E):\nThe problem states \"Costco Stock Price: $940\" and from the balance sheet, the number of shares outstanding is 443,126,000 (from the Consolidated Statements of Equity, \"BALANCE AT SEPTEMBER 1, 2024\" shows 443,126,000 shares).\n\nSo E = Stock price * Shares outstanding = $940 * 443,126,000\nLet me calculate that:\n$940 * 443,126,000 = $416,538,440,000 ≈ $416.54 billion\n\nBut wait, the balance sheet shows \"Common stock\" with 443,126,000 shares, so that's correct.\n\nMarket value of debt (D):\nFrom the balance sheet, the long-term debt excluding current portion is $5,794 million (as per the Consolidated Balance Sheets: \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion 5,794 5,377\" for 2024).\n\nAlso, the current portion of long-term debt is $103 million (from the balance sheet: \"Current portion of long-term debt 103 1,081\").\n\nSo total debt D = Long-term debt excluding current portion + Current portion of long-term debt = $5,794 + $103 = $5,897 million.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Costco Stock Price: $940\" and the balance sheet shows \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion $5,794\" and \"Current portion of long-term debt $103\", so total debt is $5,897 million.\n\nNow, total value of the firm V = E + D = $416,538.44 million + $5,897 million = $422,435.44 million.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. The market value of equity is in millions? Let me check the units.\n\nThe financial statements are in millions of dollars. So:\n\n- Stock price: $940 per share\n- Shares outstanding: 443,126,000 shares\n\nSo market cap = $940 * 443,126,000 = $416,538,440,000 = $416,538.44 million (since 1 billion = 1,000 million, so $416.538 billion = $416,538.44 million).\n\nDebt: $5,897 million (as calculated).\n\nSo V = $416,538.44 + $5,897 = $422,435.44 million.\n\nNow, the weights:\n- E/V = $416,538.44 / $422,435.44 ≈ 0.986\n- D/V = $5,897 / $422,435.44 ≈ 0.014\n\nNow, plug into WACC formula:\n\nWACC = (E/V)*Re + (D/V)*Rd*(1 - Tc)\n= 0.986 * 9.66% + 0.014 * 6% * (1 - 24.36%)\n= 0.986 * 9.66% + 0.014 * 6% * 0.7564\n= 9.52% + 0.014 * 4.5384%\n= 9.52% + 0.0635%\n≈ 9.5835%\n\nSo approximately 9.58%.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tax rate calculation. The tax rate is 24.36%, so (1 - Tc) = 1 - 0.2436 = 0.7564.\n\nDebt cost after tax: 6% * 0.7564 = 4.5384%.\n\nThen, D/V * Rd*(1-Tc) = 0.014 * 4.5384% ≈ 0.0635%.\n\nE/V * Re = 0.986 * 9.66% ≈ 9.52%.\n\nSo total WACC ≈ 9.52% + 0.0635% = 9.5835%, which rounds to 9.58%.\n\nBut let me check if the debt value should be the market value or book value. The problem says \"market value of debt\", but the balance sheet shows book value. However, the problem doesn't provide market value of debt, so we'll use book value as an approximation. The problem states \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" as $5,794 million, and current portion as $103 million, so total debt book value is $5,897 million.\n\nAlso, the stock price is given as $940, which is the market price, so market cap is correct.\n\nAnother thing: the problem says \"Costco Stock Price: $940\", but I should confirm if this is the closing price or something. But since it's given, I'll use it.\n\nNow, let me verify the tax rate again. Income before taxes is $9,740 million, tax provision is $2,373 million. So tax rate = 2,373 / 9,740 = 0.2436, so 24.36%. Correct.\n\nCost of equity calculation:\nRisk-free rate = 4.617%\nMarket return = 11%\nBeta = 0.79\nRe = 4.617% + 0.79*(11% - 4.617%) = 4.617% + 0.79*6.383% = 4.617% + 5.04257% = 9.65957% ≈ 9.66%. Correct.\n\nSo WACC = (416,538.44 / 422,435.44)*9.66% + (5,897 / 422,435.44)*6%*(1-0.2436)\n\nLet me calculate more precisely:\n\nE/V = 416,538.44 / 422,435.44 = 0.98603\nD/V = 5,897 / 422,435.44 = 0.01397\n\nSo:\nE/V * Re = 0.98603 * 9.66% = 9.522%\nD/V * Rd * (1-Tc) = 0.01397 * 6% * 0.7564 = 0.01397 * 4.5384% = 0.0635%\n\nTotal WACC = 9.522% + 0.0635% = 9.5855% ≈ 9.59%\n\nWait, 0.01397 * 4.5384 = let's calculate:\n0.01 * 4.5384 = 0.045384\n0.00397 * 4.5384 ≈ 0.0179\nTotal ≈ 0.063284, so 0.0633%\n\nSo 9.522% + 0.0633% = 9.5853%, which rounds to 9.59%.\n\nBut in finance, WACC is often reported to two decimal places, so 9.59%.\n\nWait, but let me check if the debt is only the long-term debt. The problem says \"long-term debt\" in the balance sheet, but the current portion is included. So total debt is $5,897 million.\n\nAnother thing: the problem says \"Costco Stock Price: $940\", but is this the price per share? Yes, and shares outstanding are 443,126,000, so market cap is $940 * 443,126,000 = $416,538,440,000 = $416,538.44 million. Correct.\n\nNow, let's confirm the numbers:\n\n- Market cap: $416,538.44 million\n- Debt: $5,897 million\n- Total value: $422,435.44 million\n\nE/V = 416,538.44 / 422,435.44 = 0.98603\nD/V = 5,897 / 422,435.44 = 0.01397\n\nRe = 9.66%\nRd = 6%\nTc = 24.36%\n\nSo WACC = 0.98603*9.66 + 0.01397*6*(1-0.2436)\n= 9.522 + 0.01397*6*0.7564\n= 9.522 + 0.01397*4.5384\n= 9.522 + 0.0635\n= 9.5855%\n\nSo approximately 9.59%.\n\nBut let me check if the tax rate should be applied to the debt. Yes, because interest is tax-deductible, so we use Rd*(1-Tc).\n\nAnother point: the problem says \"Cost of Debt: 6%\". Is this the pre-tax cost of debt? Yes, so we need to multiply by (1-Tc).\n\nNow, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the balance sheet again for debt. The balance sheet shows:\n\n\"Long-term debt, excluding current portion 5,794 5,377\"\n\n\"Current portion of long-term debt 103 1,081\"\n\nSo total debt = 5,794 + 103 = 5,897 million. Correct.\n\nAlso, the problem states \"Costco Stock Price: $940\", which is the market price, so market cap is correct.\n\nSo the WACC is approximately 9.59%.\n\nBut let me see if there's any other information I missed. The problem also gives \"Membership\" details, but I don't think that's relevant for WACC calculation.\n\nAlso, the \"Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\" and other notes don't seem relevant for WACC.\n\nSo, final WACC is 9.59%.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation once more:\n\nRe = 4.617% + 0.79*(11 - 4.617) = 4.617 + 0.79*6.383 = 4.617 + 5.04257 = 9.65957% ≈ 9.66%\n\nTax rate = 2373 / 9740 = 0.2436 = 24.36%\n\nDebt after tax = 6% * (1 - 0.2436) = 6% * 0.7564 = 4.5384%\n\nE/V = 416538.44 / (416538.44 + 5897) = 416538.44 / 422435.44 = 0.98603\n\nD/V = 5897 / 422435.44 = 0.01397\n\nWACC = (0.98603 * 9.66) + (0.01397 * 4.5384)\n= 9.522 + 0.0635\n= 9.5855% ≈ 9.59%\n\nYes, so 9.59%.\n\nBut in some contexts, WACC is rounded to two decimal places, so 9.59%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate Costco's WACC for 2024, the following components are required:\n\n1. **Cost of Equity (Re)** using CAPM:\n   - Risk-free rate (10Y Treasury) = 4.617%\n   - Beta = 0.79\n   - Market return = 11%\n   - Re = 4.617% + 0.79 × (11% - 4.617%) = 9.66%\n\n2. **Cost of Debt (Rd)** = 6% (given)\n\n3. **Tax Rate (Tc)**:\n   - Income tax provision = $2,373 million\n   - Income before taxes = $9,740 million\n   - Tc = $2,373 / $9,740 = 24.36%\n\n4. **Market Value of Equity (E)**:\n   - Stock price = $940\n   - Shares outstanding = 443,126,000\n   - E = $940 × 443,126,000 = $416,538.44 million\n\n5. **Market Value of Debt (D)**:\n   - Long-term debt (excluding current portion) = $5,794 million\n   - Current portion of long-term debt = $103 million\n   - D = $5,794 + $103 = $5,897 million\n\n6. **Total Firm Value (V)**:\n   - V = E + D = $416,538.44 + $5,897 = $422,435.44 million\n\n7. **Weights**:\n   - E/V = $416,538.44 / $422,435.44 = 0.9860\n   - D/V = $5,897 / $422,435.44 = 0.0140\n\n8. **WACC Calculation**:\n   - WACC = (E/V) × Re + (D/V) × Rd × (1 - Tc)\n   - WACC = (0.9860 × 9.66%) + (0.0140 × 6% × 0.7564)\n   - WACC = 9.522% + 0.0635% = 9.5855% ≈ 9.59%\n\n<answer>:9.59%",

      "question": "What is market debt to equity ratio?",
      "ground_truth": "2.73%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about the market debt to equity ratio. First, I need to recall what the market debt to equity ratio actually means. From what I remember, it's a financial metric that compares a company's total debt to its shareholders' equity, but using market values rather than book values. Wait, but sometimes people confuse it with the book value ratio. The question is asking for the market debt to equity ratio, so I need to make sure I'm using market values.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements for Costco, I need to find the relevant numbers. The balance sheet shows total liabilities and equity. But the market debt to equity ratio would require the market value of debt and equity, not the book values. However, the problem might be simplifying it to use book values if market values aren't provided. Let me check the context again.\n\nThe user provided a lot of financial data, including the balance sheet. On the balance sheet, total liabilities are $46,209 million (as of Sept 1, 2024), and total equity is $23,622 million. But wait, the market debt to equity ratio typically uses market values. However, in many cases, especially in problems like this, they might just want the book value ratio. But the question specifies \"market,\" so I should check if there's market value data.\n\nLooking through the provided context, there's a note about the stock price: \"Costco Stock Price: $940\". Also, the number of shares outstanding is 443,126,000 (from the balance sheet under common stock). So the market value of equity would be stock price multiplied by shares outstanding. Let me calculate that.\n\nStock price: $940\nShares outstanding: 443,126,000\nMarket value of equity = 940 * 443,126,000 = let's compute that. 940 * 443,126,000 = 940 * 443.126 million = approximately 416,538.44 million. Wait, 940 * 443,126,000 = 940 * 443.126 * 1,000,000 = 416,538.44 * 1,000,000 = $416,538.44 million.\n\nNow, for debt. The balance sheet shows total liabilities as $46,209 million, but that includes both debt and other liabilities. The long-term debt excluding current portion is $5,794 million, and current portion of long-term debt is $103 million. So total debt would be $5,794 + $103 = $5,897 million. But wait, the balance sheet lists \"Total Liabilities\" as $46,209 million, which includes accounts payable, accrued liabilities, etc. So the actual debt (interest-bearing) is the long-term debt plus current portion. The note 4 mentions \"Long-Term Debt\" and \"Short-Term Borrowings\" which were immaterial. So the total debt is $5,897 million.\n\nBut the problem is, the market debt to equity ratio would use the market value of debt. However, debt is often close to book value, especially if interest rates haven't changed much. The problem states \"Costco Stock Price: $940\" but doesn't give market value of debt. So maybe they expect us to use book value of debt for simplicity, as market value of debt is often approximated by book value.\n\nSo, market debt to equity ratio = (Market Value of Debt) / (Market Value of Equity). But since market value of debt isn't provided, and the problem might be using book value for debt, but the question says \"market,\" which is confusing. Wait, maybe the question is misstated, and they actually want the book debt to equity ratio. But the question specifically says \"market.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this context, \"market debt to equity\" refers to the ratio using market values for equity and book for debt. Let's proceed with that.\n\nMarket value of equity = $940 * 443,126,000 = $416,538.44 million (as calculated).\n\nTotal debt (book value) = current portion of long-term debt + long-term debt excluding current portion = $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million.\n\nSo debt to equity ratio (market) = 5,897 / 416,538.44 ≈ 0.01416, or 1.42%.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects the ratio as a decimal or percentage. Typically, debt to equity is expressed as a ratio, like 0.014 or 1.4%.\n\nWait, but the problem might be asking for the book debt to equity ratio, which is total liabilities / total equity. But total liabilities include non-debt items like accounts payable. The standard debt to equity ratio usually uses interest-bearing debt, not total liabilities. So the correct approach is to use interest-bearing debt (long-term debt + current portion) divided by equity.\n\nIn the balance sheet, total liabilities are $46,209 million, but that's not the debt. The debt is specifically the long-term debt and current portion. So using $5,897 million as debt.\n\nEquity is $23,622 million (book value), but for market ratio, we should use market value of equity, which is $416,538.44 million.\n\nSo debt to equity ratio (market) = 5,897 / 416,538.44 ≈ 0.01416, which is 1.42%.\n\nBut let me confirm the numbers again. From the balance sheet:\n\nTotal liabilities: $46,209 million.\n\nBut within that, long-term debt excluding current portion: $5,794 million.\n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt: $103 million.\n\nSo total debt (interest-bearing) = 5,794 + 103 = $5,897 million.\n\nMarket value of equity: 443,126,000 shares * $940 = 443,126,000 * 940.\n\nCalculating that: 443,126,000 * 900 = 398,813,400,000; 443,126,000 * 40 = 17,725,040,000. Total = 398,813,400,000 + 17,725,040,000 = 416,538,440,000, which is $416,538.44 million.\n\nSo debt to equity = 5,897 / 416,538.44 ≈ 0.01416, or 1.42%.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"market debt to equity ratio,\" which is a bit ambiguous. Sometimes \"market debt to equity\" might refer to the ratio using market values for both, but debt market value is usually close to book value. So this should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem expects the answer as a percentage or a decimal. The standard way is to present it as a decimal or percentage. In finance, it's often a decimal (e.g., 0.014) or percentage (1.4%).\n\nLooking at the context, the user might expect the ratio as a decimal. But let's see if there's a standard. For example, if debt is $5.897B and equity is $416.54B, the ratio is 5.897 / 416.54 ≈ 0.01416, so 0.014 or 1.4%.\n\nBut the problem says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" So probably as a decimal rounded to three decimal places or as a percentage.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes \"debt to equity\" is expressed as a ratio, like 1.4%, meaning 1.4% of equity is debt. So 1.4%.\n\nBut let me check if the problem might have a typo and actually wants the book debt to equity ratio. If using book values:\n\nDebt (book) = $5,897 million\n\nEquity (book) = $23,622 million\n\nBook debt to equity = 5,897 / 23,622 ≈ 0.2496, or 24.96%.\n\nBut the question says \"market,\" so it should be the market value of equity. So the market ratio is much lower, around 1.4%.\n\nGiven that the problem provided the stock price, it's clear they want the market value of equity. So the answer should be approximately 1.4%.\n\nWait, but let's compute it precisely.\n\n5,897 / 416,538.44 = ?\n\n5,897 ÷ 416,538.44 ≈ 0.01416, so 1.42% when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut the problem might expect it as a decimal. However, in financial contexts, debt to equity ratios are often presented as percentages. For example, a ratio of 0.014 is 1.4%.\n\nLooking at the instructions: \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\"\n\nSo probably as a percentage, rounded to two decimal places: 1.42%.\n\nBut let me check if the numbers are correct. Wait, the current portion of long-term debt is $103 million, and long-term debt excluding current portion is $5,794 million. So total debt is $5,897 million. That's correct.\n\nMarket value of equity: 443,126,000 shares * $940 = $416,538,440,000, which is $416,538.44 million.\n\nSo 5,897 / 416,538.44 = 0.01416, so 1.42%.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, another point: sometimes \"debt\" in debt to equity ratio refers to total liabilities, but that's not standard. The standard is interest-bearing debt. For example, accounts payable is not considered debt for this ratio. So using the debt numbers from the balance sheet (long-term debt + current portion) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the market debt to equity ratio is approximately 1.42%.\n\nBut let me check if the problem might have a different approach. For example, maybe they want the ratio of total liabilities to equity, but that's not standard. The question says \"debt,\" not \"liabilities.\"\n\nGiven that, I think 1.42% is the answer.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"market debt to equity ratio,\" and in some contexts, \"market\" might refer to the market value of debt, but since debt market value isn't provided, and it's common to use book value for debt, the calculation should be as above.\n\nSo the final answer should be 1.42%.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:1.42%",

      "question": "What is the Debt to Value in 2024?",
      "ground_truth": "2.65%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking for the Debt to Value ratio in 2024. First, I need to recall what Debt to Value means. From what I remember, Debt to Value is typically the ratio of total debt to the total value of the company, which is often calculated as total debt divided by the sum of debt and equity. But sometimes it's referred to as Debt to Enterprise Value, which would be total debt plus equity minus cash. Wait, no, let me think carefully.\n\nWait, the standard Debt to Value ratio in finance is usually Debt divided by (Debt + Equity), but sometimes it's Debt to Enterprise Value (EV), which is Debt + Equity - Cash. But the question says \"Debt to Value,\" so I need to check the context. Looking at the provided financial statements, I should find the relevant numbers.\n\nLooking at the Consolidated Balance Sheet for September 1, 2024 (the most recent year), the liabilities and equity section shows:\n\nTotal Liabilities: $46,209 million\nTotal Equity: $23,622 million\n\nBut wait, the question is about Debt to Value. Debt usually refers to the total debt, not total liabilities. So I need to find the total debt from the balance sheet. In the balance sheet, under Liabilities, there's \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" and \"Current portion of long-term debt.\" Let me check.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt: $103 million\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\n\nSo total debt would be $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million.\n\nWait, but sometimes debt includes other items, but in this case, the balance sheet lists \"Long-term debt\" and \"Current portion,\" so total debt is $5,897 million.\n\nNow, \"Value\" here likely refers to Enterprise Value, which is typically Debt + Equity - Cash. But sometimes it's just Debt to Equity ratio. Wait, the question says \"Debt to Value,\" which is a bit ambiguous. But in finance, Debt to Value often refers to the ratio of debt to the total value of the firm, which is Debt / (Debt + Equity). However, sometimes it's calculated as Debt / Enterprise Value (Debt + Equity - Cash).\n\nWait, let's check the context. The problem might be expecting a specific calculation. Let's see the numbers.\n\nTotal Debt (from balance sheet): Current portion + Long-term debt = $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million.\n\nTotal Equity: $23,622 million (from the balance sheet under Total Equity).\n\nBut if it's Debt to Value, and Value is the total capital (Debt + Equity), then Debt to Value would be Debt / (Debt + Equity).\n\nSo Debt = $5,897 million\nDebt + Equity = $5,897 + $23,622 = $29,519 million\n\nDebt to Value = 5,897 / 29,519 ≈ 0.20 or 20%.\n\nBut wait, sometimes \"Value\" refers to Enterprise Value, which is Debt + Equity - Cash. Let's check that.\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of Sept 1, 2024: $9,906 million.\n\nEnterprise Value = Debt + Equity - Cash = 5,897 + 23,622 - 9,906 = 19,613 million.\n\nThen Debt to Enterprise Value would be 5,897 / 19,613 ≈ 0.30 or 30%.\n\nBut the question says \"Debt to Value,\" not \"Debt to Enterprise Value.\" In some contexts, \"Value\" might mean the total market value of the firm, which would be Equity + Debt - Cash. But I need to see which one is standard.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement, the user provided a note: \"Costco Stock Price: $940\" and other data. But the question is based on the financial statements, so probably the accounting-based Debt to Value ratio.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes \"Debt to Value\" is used interchangeably with Debt to Equity, but that's not standard. Debt to Equity is Debt / Equity.\n\nBut the question says \"Debt to Value,\" so likely Debt / (Debt + Equity).\n\nLet me check the balance sheet again. Total Liabilities are $46,209 million, but that includes all liabilities, not just debt. So total debt is the long-term debt plus current portion, which is $5,897 million.\n\nTotal Equity is $23,622 million.\n\nSo Debt to Value (assuming Value = Debt + Equity) would be 5,897 / (5,897 + 23,622) = 5,897 / 29,519 ≈ 0.20 or 20%.\n\nBut let's confirm with the numbers. Let's calculate:\n\nDebt = $5,897 million\nEquity = $23,622 million\nTotal Capital = Debt + Equity = 5,897 + 23,622 = 29,519\n\nDebt to Value = 5,897 / 29,519 = 0.20 (20%).\n\nAlternatively, if \"Value\" refers to Enterprise Value (Debt + Equity - Cash), then:\n\nEnterprise Value = 5,897 + 23,622 - 9,906 = 19,613\n\nDebt to EV = 5,897 / 19,613 ≈ 0.30 (30%).\n\nBut the question is from a financial reasoning agent, so I need to see which one is standard. In many contexts, especially in finance, Debt to Value might refer to the ratio of debt to the total value of the firm, which is Enterprise Value. However, the term \"Debt to Value\" is not standard; it's usually Debt to Equity or Debt to Enterprise Value.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement, the user provided \"Costco Stock Price: $940\" and other data, but the question is based on the financial statements. The balance sheet shows total debt as $5,897 million (current portion + long-term debt), and equity as $23,622 million.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes \"Debt to Value\" is used in the context of the debt-to-equity ratio, but that's not accurate. Debt-to-equity is Debt / Equity.\n\nBut let's check the numbers. If it's Debt to Equity, it would be 5,897 / 23,622 ≈ 0.25 or 25%. But the question says \"Debt to Value,\" not \"Debt to Equity.\"\n\nWait, the problem might be referring to the Debt to Enterprise Value ratio. Let's see what the standard is. In finance, Enterprise Value (EV) is often used as a measure of a company's total value, and EV is calculated as Market Cap + Debt - Cash. But here, we're using book values, not market values.\n\nThe problem says \"Debt to Value,\" and since it's based on the financial statements, it's likely using book values. So Enterprise Value (book) would be Debt + Equity - Cash.\n\nSo:\n\nDebt = $5,897 million\nEquity = $23,622 million\nCash = $9,906 million\n\nEnterprise Value (book) = 5,897 + 23,622 - 9,906 = 19,613 million\n\nDebt to EV = 5,897 / 19,613 ≈ 0.3006 or 30.1%.\n\nBut the question might be expecting the Debt to (Debt + Equity) ratio, which is 20%.\n\nWait, let's check the balance sheet again. Total Liabilities and Equity is $69,831 million. Total Assets are $69,831 million. So Total Liabilities + Equity = $69,831 million.\n\nBut Total Liabilities include more than just debt. Total Liabilities are $46,209 million, which includes accounts payable, accrued liabilities, etc. So the debt is only a part of that.\n\nSo the correct debt is the long-term debt plus current portion, which is $5,897 million.\n\nNow, the question is, what is \"Value\" here? If it's the total value of the firm, it's Debt + Equity. But Equity is $23,622 million, so Debt + Equity = $29,519 million.\n\nSo Debt to Value = 5,897 / 29,519 = 0.20 or 20%.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Value\" refers to the total assets, but that's not standard. Total assets are $69,831 million, so 5,897 / 69,831 ≈ 8.4%, but that's not a standard ratio.\n\nAnother possibility: sometimes \"Debt to Value\" refers to the ratio of debt to the market value of equity, but that's not likely here since we're using financial statements.\n\nGiven that the problem is based on the financial statements, and the standard ratios, I think the intended calculation is Debt / (Debt + Equity).\n\nLet me verify with the numbers:\n\nDebt = $5,897 million\nDebt + Equity = $5,897 + $23,622 = $29,519 million\nDebt to Value = 5,897 / 29,519 = 0.20 (20%)\n\nSo the answer should be 20%.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's any other debt. The balance sheet shows \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" as $5,794 and \"Current portion of long-term debt\" as $103, so total debt is $5,897. That's correct.\n\nEquity is $23,622 million.\n\nSo 5,897 / (5,897 + 23,622) = 5,897 / 29,519 ≈ 0.20.\n\nYes, 20%.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking for Debt to Equity, it would be 5,897 / 23,622 ≈ 0.25 or 25%, but the question says \"Debt to Value,\" not \"Debt to Equity.\"\n\nGiven that, I think 20% is the answer.\n\nWait, but let's check if \"Value\" refers to Enterprise Value. In some contexts, especially in valuation, Debt to Enterprise Value is a common ratio. But the problem says \"Debt to Value,\" not \"Debt to Enterprise Value.\"\n\nHowever, given that the problem is from a financial reasoning agent, and the context includes \"Costco Stock Price: $940,\" but the question is based on the financial statements, which use book values, not market values.\n\nSo using book values, Enterprise Value would be Debt + Equity - Cash.\n\nSo:\n\nDebt = $5,897\nEquity = $23,622\nCash = $9,906\n\nEV = 5,897 + 23,622 - 9,906 = 19,613\n\nDebt to EV = 5,897 / 19,613 ≈ 0.3006 or 30.1%.\n\nBut the question says \"Debt to Value,\" not \"Debt to Enterprise Value.\" So which one is it?\n\nHmm. Let's see if there's a standard definition. In finance, the Debt to Value ratio isn't a standard term. The standard terms are:\n\n- Debt to Equity (D/E)\n- Debt to Capital (D/(D+E))\n- Debt to Enterprise Value (D/EV)\n\nGiven that, \"Debt to Value\" might be a misnomer for Debt to Capital, which is D/(D+E).\n\nIn that case, it's 20%.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is using \"Value\" to mean Enterprise Value, then it's 30%.\n\nBut I need to see which one is more likely. Let's check the numbers again.\n\nThe problem states: \"What is the Debt to Value in 2024?\"\n\nGiven that the balance sheet shows Total Liabilities and Equity as $69,831 million, but that's not helpful.\n\nAnother way: sometimes \"Value\" refers to the market value of equity, but since we don't have market cap here (though they provided stock price), but the question is based on the financial statements, so it's likely using book values.\n\nThe stock price is $940, and shares outstanding are 443,126,000. So market cap would be 940 * 443,126,000 = approximately $416,538 million. But that's market cap, not book value.\n\nBut the problem says \"based on all the original and reasoning context,\" which includes the financial statements, so it's probably using book values.\n\nGiven that, and the standard ratios, I think the intended answer is Debt / (Debt + Equity) = 20%.\n\nLet me calculate it precisely:\n\nDebt = 5,897\nDebt + Equity = 5,897 + 23,622 = 29,519\n\n5,897 / 29,519 = 0.20 (exactly 20% when rounded).\n\nYes, 5,897 ÷ 29,519 = 0.2000 (approximately).\n\nSo the answer is 20%.\n\nWait, but let's check if the current portion of debt is included. Yes, the current portion is part of debt, so it's included in total debt.\n\nAnother check: the balance sheet shows \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" as $5,794 and \"Current portion of long-term debt\" as $103, so total debt is $5,897. Correct.\n\nEquity is $23,622 million.\n\nSo Debt to Value (Debt/(Debt+Equity)) = 5,897 / (5,897 + 23,622) = 5,897 / 29,519 = 0.20.\n\nSo 20%.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe Debt to Value ratio is calculated as total debt divided by (total debt + total equity). From the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 1, 2024:\n\n- Total debt = Current portion of long-term debt ($103 million) + Long-term debt, excluding current portion ($5,794 million) = $5,897 million\n- Total equity = $23,622 million\n- Total debt + total equity = $5,897 million + $23,622 million = $29,519 million\n- Debt to Value = $5,897 / $29,519 = 0.20 or 20%\n\n<answer>:20%",

      "ground_truth": "97.35%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find the Equity to Value ratio for Costco in 2024. Let me recall what Equity to Value means. It's typically the ratio of equity to the total value of the company, which would be equity plus debt. But sometimes it's calculated as equity divided by enterprise value (EV), which is equity plus debt minus cash. Wait, no—Enterprise Value is usually debt plus equity minus cash. But Equity to Value might refer to the proportion of equity in the total capital structure.\n\nLooking at the financial statements provided, I should check the balance sheet for 2024. The balance sheet shows Total Equity as $23,622 million. Total Liabilities are $46,209 million. But Equity to Value—what's the \"Value\" here? In finance, \"Value\" often refers to Enterprise Value, which is Equity + Debt - Cash. But sometimes it's just the market value of equity, but the question says \"Equity to Value,\" so probably the ratio of equity to enterprise value.\n\nWait, the question is \"Equity to Value in 2024.\" So I need to compute Equity / Enterprise Value.\n\nEnterprise Value (EV) is typically calculated as Market Capitalization + Debt - Cash. But the problem doesn't give market cap. Wait, but maybe in this context, \"Value\" refers to the book value of the firm, which would be Total Assets. But that's not standard. Equity to Value might mean Equity divided by Total Assets, but that's usually called Equity Ratio, not Equity to Value.\n\nWait, let's check the context. The user provided financial statements. Let me look at the balance sheet.\n\nFrom the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 1, 2024:\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831 million\n\nTotal Liabilities: $46,209 million\n\nTotal Equity: $23,622 million\n\nSo, if \"Value\" refers to Total Assets, then Equity to Value would be Equity / Total Assets = 23,622 / 69,831 ≈ 0.338 or 33.8%.\n\nBut is that the standard? Equity to Value usually isn't that. Let me think. In some contexts, especially in real estate or other industries, \"Value\" might refer to the total value of the company, but in finance, Equity to Value ratio is often used to mean the proportion of equity in the capital structure, which would be Equity / (Equity + Debt). But Debt here would be total liabilities, but usually, debt is interest-bearing debt.\n\nWait, the problem might be using \"Value\" as Enterprise Value. But Enterprise Value requires market cap. However, the problem gives a stock price: \"Costco Stock Price: $940\". So maybe we can compute Market Cap.\n\nNumber of shares outstanding: From the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Common Stock shares issued and outstanding: 443,126,000 shares (as per the Consolidated Balance Sheets, \"Common stock $0.005 par value; 900,000,000 shares authorized; 443,126,000 and 442,793,000 shares issued and outstanding\" for 2024 and 2023. So for 2024, 443,126,000 shares.\n\nSo Market Cap = 443,126,000 * $940 = let's calculate that.\n\n443,126,000 * 940 = 443,126,000 * 900 + 443,126,000 * 40 = 398,813,400,000 + 17,725,040,000 = 416,538,440,000. So approximately $416.54 billion.\n\nBut the balance sheet is in millions, so $416,538 million.\n\nNow, Debt: From the balance sheet, Total Liabilities are $46,209 million, but that includes all liabilities, not just debt. The problem mentions \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" as $5,794 million, and \"Current portion of long-term debt\" as $103 million. So Total Debt = $5,794 + $103 = $5,897 million.\n\nBut also, there's \"Short-term borrowings\" which were immaterial, so maybe ignore.\n\nCash and cash equivalents: $9,906 million.\n\nSo Enterprise Value (EV) = Market Cap + Debt - Cash = 416,538 + 5,897 - 9,906 = 416,538 + 5,897 = 422,435; 422,435 - 9,906 = 412,529 million.\n\nThen Equity to Value would be Equity / EV = 23,622 / 412,529 ≈ 0.0572 or 5.72%.\n\nBut that seems low. Wait, but Equity is $23.6 billion, EV is $412.5 billion, so 23.6 / 412.5 ≈ 5.7%. But is that the standard ratio?\n\nWait, but the question might be using \"Value\" as Total Assets. Let me check the problem statement again. The user says \"Equity to Value\", and in some contexts, especially in accounting, \"Value\" might refer to the total assets. For example, the equity ratio is equity divided by total assets.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, Total Assets are $69,831 million, Equity is $23,622 million. So Equity to Value (if Value = Total Assets) would be 23,622 / 69,831 ≈ 0.338 or 33.8%.\n\nBut why would they call it \"Equity to Value\" instead of \"Equity Ratio\"? Maybe in this context, \"Value\" means the total value of the company's assets, so Equity / Total Assets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Value\" refers to Enterprise Value, but the problem doesn't specify. However, given that the question is from a financial reasoning agent, and the context includes the balance sheet, it's possible they want the ratio of equity to total assets.\n\nWait, let's see if there's a standard definition. In finance, the equity ratio is often equity divided by total assets. For example, a common metric is the equity ratio = total equity / total assets.\n\nSo for Costco in 2024, Equity = $23,622 million, Total Assets = $69,831 million.\n\nSo Equity to Value = 23,622 / 69,831 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n23,622 ÷ 69,831 ≈ 0.3382, so 33.82%.\n\nBut the problem says \"Equity to Value\", and if \"Value\" is total assets, then that's it.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Value\" is enterprise value, but enterprise value is not directly given, and requires market cap, which is provided as $940 per share.\n\nBut the problem gives the stock price, so maybe they expect us to use that.\n\nWait, but the question is from a financial reasoning agent, and the context includes the balance sheet. Let's see if there's any other clue.\n\nThe user provided \"Costco Stock Price: $940\", so they might expect us to calculate market-based EV.\n\nBut let's check the numbers.\n\nFirst, Market Cap: Shares outstanding 443,126,000 * $940 = 443,126,000 * 940.\n\n443,126,000 * 900 = 398,813,400,000\n\n443,126,000 * 40 = 17,725,040,000\n\nTotal = 416,538,440,000 ≈ $416,538 million.\n\nDebt: From the balance sheet, Long-term debt excluding current portion is $5,794 million, current portion is $103 million, so total debt = 5,794 + 103 = $5,897 million.\n\nCash: $9,906 million.\n\nEV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash = 416,538 + 5,897 - 9,906 = 416,538 + 5,897 = 422,435; 422,435 - 9,906 = 412,529 million.\n\nEquity (book value) is $23,622 million.\n\nSo Equity to EV = 23,622 / 412,529 ≈ 0.0572 or 5.72%.\n\nBut that's a very low ratio. Typically, equity to EV is not a standard ratio; usually, it's EV to equity or something else. But the question says \"Equity to Value\", so if Value is EV, then it's equity divided by EV.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, \"Value\" might refer to the market value of equity, but that would be Market Cap, so Equity to Value would be 1, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. If \"Value\" is market value of equity, then Equity to Value would be 1, but that's trivial.\n\nSo probably, \"Value\" here refers to Enterprise Value.\n\nBut let's check the problem statement again. The user says \"Equity to Value in 2024\". In some contexts, especially in real estate, \"Value\" might mean the total asset value, so Equity / Total Assets.\n\nGiven that the balance sheet is provided, and the question is likely expecting a ratio based on the balance sheet, not market data, I think they want Equity / Total Assets.\n\nMoreover, the problem gives the stock price, but maybe that's a red herring, or for another part of the question.\n\nWait, the question is only asking for Equity to Value, and the context includes the balance sheet. So the most straightforward calculation is Equity / Total Assets.\n\nTotal Assets for 2024: $69,831 million\n\nTotal Equity: $23,622 million\n\nSo 23,622 / 69,831 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n23,622 ÷ 69,831.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 1000: 23.622 / 69.831 ≈ 0.3382.\n\nSo 33.82%.\n\nBut the problem says \"Equity to Value\", and in finance, the equity ratio is often expressed as a percentage, so 33.8%.\n\nBut let's confirm with the numbers.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831\n\nTotal Equity: $23,622\n\nSo Equity / Total Assets = 23,622 / 69,831 ≈ 0.3382 or 33.82%.\n\nRounded to two decimal places, 33.82%.\n\nBut the problem might want it as a percentage or a decimal. The instruction says \"in the correct financial format\", so probably as a percentage.\n\nBut let's see if there's another interpretation.\n\nWait, another possibility: \"Value\" might refer to the market value of the company, which would be Enterprise Value. But as I calculated earlier, that gives a different number.\n\nBut given that the problem provides the balance sheet, and the question is likely testing knowledge of basic financial ratios, Equity to Value probably means Equity to Total Assets.\n\nIn fact, in some contexts, \"Value\" is used interchangeably with \"Total Assets\" in such ratios.\n\nFor example, the debt-to-equity ratio is Debt / Equity, but equity to asset ratio is Equity / Assets.\n\nSo I think the intended answer is Equity / Total Assets = 23,622 / 69,831.\n\nLet me compute it precisely.\n\n23,622 ÷ 69,831 = ?\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n69,831 × 0.3 = 20,949.3\n\n23,622 - 20,949.3 = 2,672.7\n\n69,831 × 0.038 = 69,831 × 0.03 = 2,094.93; 69,831 × 0.008 = 558.648; total 2,094.93 + 558.648 = 2,653.578\n\nSo 0.3 + 0.038 = 0.338, and 2,672.7 - 2,653.578 = 19.122\n\nSo approximately 0.338 + (19.122 / 69,831) ≈ 0.338 + 0.00027 ≈ 0.33827, so 33.83%.\n\nBut for financial reporting, it's usually rounded to two decimal places.\n\nSo 33.83%.\n\nBut let's check the exact value.\n\n23,622 / 69,831 = ?\n\nCalculate:\n\n23,622 ÷ 69,831 = 0.3382 (approximately).\n\nSo 33.82%.\n\nBut the problem might expect it as a percentage without the % sign, or with.\n\nThe instruction says \"in the correct financial format\", so probably as a percentage, like 33.82%.\n\nBut let's see if the numbers are exact.\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831 million\n\nTotal Equity: $23,622 million\n\nSo 23,622 / 69,831 = 0.3382, so 33.82%.\n\nI think that's the answer they're looking for.\n\nThe stock price and other data might be for other questions, but for this specific question, it's a balance sheet ratio.\n\nSo the final answer should be 33.82%.\n\nWait, but let's confirm with the balance sheet.\n\nFrom the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831\n\nTotal Equity: $23,622\n\nYes.\n\nSo Equity to Value (assuming Value = Total Assets) is 23,622 / 69,831 = 33.82%.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe Equity to Value ratio is calculated as Total Equity divided by Total Assets. From the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 1, 2024:\n- Total Equity = $23,622 million\n- Total Assets = $69,831 million\n\nEquity to Value = $23,622 / $69,831 = 0.3382 or 33.82%.\n\n<answer>:33.82%",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the effective tax rate in 2024 based on the provided financial context. \n\nFirst, I need to locate where the effective tax rate is mentioned in the documents. Looking through the financial statements, I see a section under \"Note 8—Taxes\" that has a reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate. \n\nIn that reconciliation table, for 2024, it shows \"Total provision for income taxes\" as $2,373 and the effective rate as 24.4%. The table breaks down the components: Federal taxes at statutory rate (21.0%), State taxes (3.0%), Foreign taxes (1.1%), Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) (-1.2%), and Other (0.5%). Adding those up: 21.0 + 3.0 + 1.1 - 1.2 + 0.5 = 24.4%.\n\nThe question specifically asks for the effective tax rate in 2024, and the document clearly states it as 24.4% in the reconciliation. The note also mentions that the effective tax rate included discrete tax benefits, but the rate itself is already calculated as 24.4%.\n\nI should confirm there's no other mention of the effective tax rate elsewhere. Scanning through the other sections like the income statement, the provision for income taxes is $2,373, and the income before taxes is $9,740. Calculating the rate: 2,373 / 9,740 ≈ 0.2436 or 24.36%, which rounds to 24.4% as stated. So the document's reconciliation matches the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the effective tax rate for 2024 is 24.4%.\n</think>\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2024 is explicitly stated in the tax reconciliation under Note 8—Taxes, where it is calculated as 24.4% based on the total provision for income taxes ($2,373) relative to income before income taxes ($9,740).\n\n<answer>:24.4%",

      "question": "What is the marginal tax rate in 2024?",
      "ground_truth": "24.00%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the marginal tax rate in 2024. First, I need to recall what the marginal tax rate means. It's the rate at which the last dollar of income is taxed, right? But looking at the provided financial statements, I don't see any direct mention of marginal tax rates. The context is Costco's financials, so maybe I need to calculate it from the tax data given.\n\nLooking at the income tax provision in the financial statements. The \"Provision for income taxes\" for 2024 is $2,373 million. The \"Income before income taxes\" is $9,740 million. The effective tax rate is calculated as (Provision / Income before taxes) * 100. So, 2,373 / 9,740 ≈ 0.2436, which is 24.36%. But the question is about the marginal tax rate, not the effective rate. The effective rate is the average rate, while marginal is the rate on the next dollar earned.\n\nWait, but the problem might be tricking me. The user might think that the effective tax rate is the marginal rate, but they're different. However, in the absence of specific marginal tax rate information, sometimes the effective rate is used as a proxy, but that's not accurate. But looking at the provided data, there's no breakdown of marginal tax brackets. The financial statements don't provide the marginal tax rate; they provide the effective rate.\n\nWait, the question is from a financial reasoning agent. The context given is Costco's financial statements. The user might have confused the effective tax rate with the marginal tax rate. But the answer should be based on the data provided. Let me check the notes again.\n\nIn Note 8, there's a reconciliation of the statutory tax rate. The statutory rate is 21% (federal), and the effective rate is 24.4% for 2024. But statutory rate is the top marginal rate for corporations, which is 21% for 2024. Wait, the federal corporate tax rate in the US for 2024 is 21%, as per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But the question is about Costco's marginal tax rate. However, the financial statements don't state the marginal rate; they show the effective rate.\n\nWait, the problem might be expecting the statutory marginal rate, not the effective rate. But the question says \"marginal tax rate,\" which for corporations is the top rate they pay on the last dollar of taxable income. In the US, the corporate tax rate is a flat 21% for 2024. So the marginal tax rate would be 21%. But the effective rate is higher due to state taxes, foreign taxes, etc.\n\nLooking at the reconciliation in Note 8: Federal taxes at statutory rate is 21.0%, and the effective rate is 24.4%. So the statutory marginal rate is 21%, which is the rate applied to the last dollar of taxable income. The effective rate is higher because of state taxes and other factors.\n\nBut the question is asking for the marginal tax rate, not the effective rate. So the answer should be 21%, as that's the statutory corporate tax rate for 2024. The financial statements don't provide the marginal rate directly, but the statutory rate is a standard figure. The context might be testing if I confuse effective with marginal.\n\nWait, but the user provided Costco's financials, so maybe they expect me to calculate it from the data. But the marginal rate isn't calculated from the income tax provision; it's a statutory rate. The effective rate is (Provision / Income before taxes) = 2,373 / 9,740 ≈ 24.4%, but that's not the marginal rate.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 21%, as the federal corporate tax rate for 2024. The question might be a trick to see if I know that the marginal rate is the statutory rate, not the effective rate. The financial statements mention the statutory rate in the reconciliation (21.0%), so that's the marginal rate.\n\nTherefore, the marginal tax rate in 2024 is 21%.\n</think>\n\nThe question asks for the marginal tax rate in 2024. The provided financial context includes Costco's income tax reconciliation, which states the federal statutory tax rate as 21.0% (referenced in the reconciliation of the statutory tax rate to the effective rate). The marginal tax rate for corporations in the U.S. for 2024 is the statutory corporate tax rate of 21%, as the effective tax rate (24.4%) reflects additional state and foreign taxes but does not represent the marginal rate. The statutory rate is the rate applied to the last dollar of taxable income, making it the marginal rate.\n\n<answer>:21%",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the statutory or marginal taxes on adjusted EBIT. First, I need to recall what statutory tax rate means. It's the tax rate set by law, not the effective rate. The question mentions \"adjusted EBIT,\" but looking at the financial statements, EBIT is operating income. Wait, in the income statement, operating income is $9,285 million for 2024.\n\nBut the user says \"adjusted EBIT.\" Hmm, maybe they mean EBIT before tax adjustments? Wait, the income statement shows \"Income Before Income Taxes\" as $9,740 million. So EBIT would be operating income plus interest, but actually, EBIT is usually operating income. Wait, no: EBIT is earnings before interest and taxes, so it's operating income. But in the context of taxes, the statutory tax rate would apply to the taxable income.\n\nLooking at the tax notes, specifically Note 8, there's a reconciliation of the statutory tax rate. The statutory rate is 21% for federal taxes. The effective rate is 24.4% in 2024. The statutory rate is the base rate before state and other adjustments.\n\nThe question asks for statutory/marginal taxes on adjusted EBIT. But \"adjusted EBIT\" isn't standard. Maybe they mean the tax rate applied to EBIT. The statutory rate is 21%, but the effective rate is higher. However, the question specifies \"statutory,\" so it should be the 21% federal rate. But wait, the reconciliation shows \"Federal taxes at statutory rate $2,045 (21.0%)\" for 2024. So the statutory rate is 21%.\n\nWait, but the user says \"marginal taxes.\" Marginal tax rate usually refers to the rate on the last dollar earned. But in corporate tax, the statutory rate is the flat rate. For the US, the corporate tax rate is 21% since 2018. So the statutory rate is 21%.\n\nBut the question says \"on adjusted EBIT.\" Let me check if EBIT is adjusted. The operating income is $9,285, but income before taxes is $9,740. The difference is interest expense and other income. So EBIT would be operating income plus interest expense? Wait, no. EBIT is earnings before interest and taxes, so it's operating income plus interest expense. Wait, operating income is before interest and taxes. So EBIT is the same as operating income here? Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\n- Operating income: revenue minus operating expenses (so before interest and taxes)\n- EBIT: same as operating income, sometimes called operating profit.\n\nIn the income statement, \"Operating income\" is $9,285 million. Then \"Other income (expense)\" includes interest expense. So EBIT would be operating income, which is $9,285. But the tax is on income before taxes, which is $9,740. So maybe the user is confused.\n\nBut the question is about statutory tax rate, not the tax amount. The statutory rate is 21%, as per the reconciliation. The effective rate is 24.4%, but statutory is 21%.\n\nWait, the user says \"statutory / marginal taxes on adjusted EBIT.\" So they might be asking for the tax rate, not the amount. The answer should be the statutory tax rate, which is 21%.\n\nLooking at Note 8, the reconciliation shows \"Federal taxes at statutory rate $2,045 21.0%\". So the statutory rate is 21%.\n\nTherefore, the statutory tax rate is 21%. The question might be phrased as \"what is the statutory tax rate,\" but it says \"taxes,\" which could be the rate or the amount. But since it's \"statutory / marginal taxes,\" and the context is the rate, the answer is 21%.\n\nWait, but the user says \"on adjusted EBIT.\" If EBIT is $9,285, then statutory tax would be 21% of that, but the question is asking for the rate, not the amount. The way the question is phrased, \"what are the statutory / marginal taxes,\" but in finance, \"taxes\" could refer to the rate. However, the answer format should be concise in financial format. The statutory rate is 21%, so the answer is 21%.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any adjustment. The operating income is $9,285, but income before taxes is $9,740. The difference is interest expense and other income. But statutory tax rate applies to taxable income, which is income before taxes. However, the statutory rate is still 21%, regardless of the amount.\n\nThe question is likely asking for the statutory tax rate, which is 21%. So the answer should be 21%.\n\nIn the reconciliation, it's clearly stated as 21.0% for federal statutory rate.

The question probably means the income tax expense for 2024.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, specifically the Consolidated Statements of Income, I see a line item called \"Provision for income taxes.\" For the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, that amount is $2,373 million. \n\nWait, the question says \"operating tax,\" but in the context of financial statements, the tax expense is part of the income statement, not an operating expense.

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the operating cash tax in 2024. Hmm, I need to find where that's reported in the financial statements provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the documents. The main financial statements are the Consolidated Statements of Income, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flows. The question is about \"operating cash tax,\" which probably refers to the cash paid for income taxes during the operating activities.\n\nLooking at the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, there's a section called \"SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION\" which lists \"Cash paid during the year for: Interest Income taxes, net\". The numbers there are $2,319 for 2024. Wait, but the question says \"operating cash tax,\" so that should be the cash paid for income taxes, not interest.\n\nWait, the line item says \"Income taxes, net\" and the amount for 2024 is $2,319 million. Let me check the context again. The user's question is \"operating cash tax,\" which in financial terms usually means the cash paid for income taxes during the operating activities. The cash flow statement's supplemental info shows \"Income taxes, net\" as $2,319 for 2024. \n\nLooking at the Consolidated Statements of Income, the Provision for income taxes is $2,373 million for 2024. But that's the accrual-based tax expense, not the cash paid. The cash paid would be different because of timing differences, like deferred taxes. The supplemental disclosure gives the actual cash paid, which is $2,319 million. \n\nWait, the question says \"operating cash tax,\" which might be a bit confusing. But in the context of cash flow statements, the cash paid for income taxes is a standard line item. The supplemental disclosure clearly states \"Cash paid during the year for: Income taxes, net $2,319\" for 2024. So that's the number they're looking for.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any other mention. The Notes section, like Note 8 on Taxes, talks about the provision for income taxes, but the cash paid is in the cash flow statement's supplemental info. So yes, $2,319 million is the correct figure. The answer should be $2,319 million, but since the question asks for the amount in the required format, probably just the number with the correct units.\n\nWait, the problem says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" So likely $2,319 million, but maybe just the number. But looking at the context, the numbers are in millions, so the answer should be 2319 (since it's in millions). But the question says \"operating cash tax,\" and the cash paid is $2,319 million. So the answer is 2319.\n\nWait, the supplemental disclosure says \"$2,319 $2,234 $1,940\" for 2024, 2023, 2022. So the 2024 amount is 2,319 million. So the answer should be 2319, but in the context of the problem, they might want it as $2,319 million. But the instructions say \"concise, in the correct financial format.\" Looking at the original context, the numbers are presented as \"$2,319\" in the cash flow statement. So the answer should be $2,319 million. But the user might expect just the number without the dollar sign, but the problem says \"correct financial format,\" which usually includes the dollar sign and million.\n\nWait, the problem's example in the context shows \"Provision for income taxes 2,373\" in millions. So the answer should be 2319 (since it's in millions, but the number is 2,319). Wait, the cash paid is $2,319 million, so the number is 2319. But in the answer, they might want it as 2319 or $2,319. The instructions say \"concise,\" so probably $2,319 million. But looking at the way the numbers are presented in the statements, they use \"$2,319\" followed by the unit (million). So the answer should be $2,319 million. However, the problem says \"final answer must be concise,\" so maybe just 2319. But to be safe, check the context.\n\nIn the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the supplemental info says \"Income taxes, net $2,319 $2,234 $1,940\". So the 2024 figure is $2,319 million. So the answer is $2,319 million. But the user might want it without the dollar sign and \"million,\" but the problem says \"correct financial format.\" In financial statements, it's common to say $2,319 million. However, the answer format instructions say \"exact final answer\" and \"concise.\" The previous examples in the problem use numbers like \"2,373\" in the income statement, but the actual value is 2,373 million. So the answer should be 2319 (since it's in millions, but the number is 2,319). Wait, no—the number is 2,319 million, so the value is 2319 (as the unit is millions). But in the answer, they might expect the number as written, so $2,319 million. But the problem says \"in the correct financial format,\" so probably $2,319 million. However, the user's example in the problem statement shows \"Provision for income taxes 2,373\" (in millions), so the answer should be 2319. Wait, but the actual number is 2,319, so the answer is 2319 (since it's in millions, the comma is omitted in the answer? Or included?).\n\nWait, looking at the problem's context, the numbers are presented with commas as thousand separators. For example, \"249,625\" for net sales. So the answer should be 2,319. But the problem says \"concise,\" so maybe without the comma. But in financial contexts, it's standard to use commas. However, the instructions say \"exact final answer,\" so probably as it appears in the document: $2,319 million. But the user might want just the number. Wait, the question is \"What is the operating cash tax in 2024?\" and the answer is $2,319 million. But the problem's context uses \"amounts in millions,\" so the answer is 2,319 (since it's already in millions). So the answer should be 2319, but written as 2,319. Wait, the problem's example in the income statement says \"Provision for income taxes 2,373\" (which is 2,373 million), so the answer should be 2,319.\n\nWait, the supplemental disclosure says \"$2,319\" for 2024. So the answer is $2,319 million. But the problem says \"final answer must be concise,\" so perhaps just 2319. But in the context of the problem, the numbers are presented with commas, so 2,319. However, the user might expect the answer as a number without the dollar sign. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe original question is \"What is the operating cash tax in 2024?\" and the context shows \"Income taxes, net $2,319\" in the cash flow statement. So the answer is $2,319 million. But since the problem says \"in the correct financial format,\" and the numbers in the statements are presented as \"$2,319\" followed by the unit (million), the answer should be $2,319 million. However, the instructions say \"concise,\" so maybe just $2,319. But the problem's example in the income statement lists the number as \"2,373\" (without the dollar sign in the table, but the context says \"amounts in millions\"). Wait, looking at the Consolidated Statements of Income, the numbers are listed as \"2,373\" under Provision for income taxes, with a note that amounts are in millions. So the answer should be 2,319.\n\nWait, the problem says \"amounts in millions, except per share data,\" so the number 2,319 represents $2,319 million. So the answer is 2,319. But to confirm, the cash paid for income taxes is $2,319 million, so the numerical value is 2,319 (since it's in millions). Therefore, the answer should be 2,319.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no other line item. The question says \"operating cash tax,\" which is the cash paid for income taxes, which is exactly what the supplemental disclosure shows. So yes, $2,319 million, so the number is 2,319.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:2,319",

      "question": "Calculate Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities in 2024",
      "ground_truth": "-$535 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this problem. The question is asking for the Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities in 2024. \n\nFirst, I need to find where deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported in the financial statements. Looking at the provided context, I see Note 8—Taxes, which has a section on deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nIn Note 8, there's a table titled \"The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:\" for 2024 and 2023. Let me check the 2024 figures.\n\nFor deferred tax assets in 2024:\n- Equity compensation: $96\n- Deferred income/membership fees: $313\n- Foreign tax credit carry forward: $315\n- Operating lease liabilities: $678\n- Accrued liabilities and reserves: $873\n- Other: $20\nTotal deferred tax assets: $2,275\n\nThen there's a valuation allowance of ($494), so net deferred tax assets before liabilities would be $2,275 - $494 = $1,781.\n\nNow for deferred tax liabilities in 2024:\n- Property and equipment: ($948)\n- Merchandise inventories: ($296)\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: ($652)\n- Foreign branch deferreds: ($105)\n- Other: ($1)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities: ($2,002)\n\nThe question asks for \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities.\" So I need to calculate net deferred tax assets minus deferred tax liabilities. Wait, but the note says \"Total net deferred tax assets\" is $1,781 and \"Total deferred tax liabilities\" is ($2,002). Then it shows \"Net deferred tax liabilities $ (221) $ (304)\".\n\nSo the net deferred tax liability is $221 (negative number). But the question is asking for \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities.\" Hmm. Wait, maybe they want the net position after considering both assets and liabilities.\n\nLooking at the note: \"Total net deferred tax assets 1,781 1,685\" and \"Total deferred tax liabilities (2,002) (1,989)\", then \"Net deferred tax liabilities $ (221) $ (304)\".\n\nSo the net position is a liability of $221. But the question says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities.\" That phrasing is a bit confusing. Typically, if net deferred tax assets are positive, it's an asset; if negative, it's a liability.\n\nIn this case, the net is a liability of $221. But the question specifically says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset\", which might be a misnomer. However, looking at the components, the operating lease liabilities are part of the deferred tax assets. Wait, the deferred tax assets include \"Operating lease liabilities\" as a component. But the net position is a liability.\n\nWait, the note says \"Operating lease liabilities\" under deferred tax assets. But the net deferred tax position is a liability. So the question might be asking for the net deferred tax asset position after offsetting liabilities, but in this case, it's a net liability.\n\nBut the question says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities.\" So perhaps they want the asset side minus the liability side. But in the note, the total net deferred tax assets are $1,781, and total deferred tax liabilities are $2,002, so net is $1,781 - $2,002 = -$221, which is a liability.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities.\" Maybe they want the asset part that's related to operations, but the note doesn't separate operating from non-operating. The deferred tax assets include items like operating lease liabilities, which are operating.\n\nWait, the note lists \"Operating lease liabilities\" as a component of deferred tax assets. So the deferred tax asset related to operating leases is $678. But the question is asking for the total operating deferred tax asset net of liabilities. Hmm.\n\nWait, the note says \"Total net deferred tax assets\" is $1,781, which includes all deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance. Then total deferred tax liabilities are $2,002. So net is $1,781 - $2,002 = -$221.\n\nBut the question is asking for \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities.\" The term \"operating\" might refer to the operating lease part. But the note doesn't specify \"operating\" in the deferred tax assets; it's just a component.\n\nWait, looking back at the note: \"Operating lease liabilities\" is listed under deferred tax assets. So the deferred tax asset related to operating leases is $678. But the question is asking for the total operating deferred tax asset net of liabilities. Wait, no, the question says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities.\" So maybe they want the total deferred tax asset (which includes operating lease liabilities as a component) minus the deferred tax liabilities.\n\nBut the note already calculates the net as ($221). So the answer should be ($221), but since it's a liability, it's negative. However, the question says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset,\" which might be a mistake, but the net position is a liability.\n\nWait, the note says \"Net deferred tax liabilities $ (221) $ (304)\". So for 2024, it's ($221). But the question is phrased as \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities.\" If they're asking for the net position, it's a liability of $221, so the answer would be negative 221.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Maybe \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset\" refers to the asset part related to operations, but the note doesn't separate that. The deferred tax assets include operating lease liabilities, which are part of operating activities. But the net position is a liability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is misworded, and they just want the net deferred tax position, which is a liability of $221. So the answer should be ($221), but in financial terms, it's often presented as a negative number or with parentheses.\n\nLooking at the note, it's written as \"$ (221)\", so the answer should be -221 or (221). But the question says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset\", which might be confusing, but the calculation shows a net liability.\n\nWait, the question says \"net of deferred tax liabilities\", so it's assets minus liabilities. If assets are $1,781 and liabilities are $2,002, then 1,781 - 2,002 = -221. So the net is a liability of $221.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be -221, but in the required format, probably as a negative number or in parentheses. The note uses parentheses for negative numbers, so maybe (221), but the instruction says \"in the correct financial format.\"\n\nLooking at the note, it's written as \"$ (221)\", so the answer should be -221 or (221). But the problem says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\"\n\nIn financial statements, negative numbers are often in parentheses, so (221). But sometimes they use a minus sign. However, the note uses parentheses, so I'll go with (221).\n\nWait, but the question says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset\", which might imply they want the asset side, but the net is a liability. So the answer is a negative number.\n\nWait, let me confirm the numbers again. From the note:\n\nTotal net deferred tax assets: $1,781\n\nTotal deferred tax liabilities: $2,002\n\nNet deferred tax liabilities: $1,781 - $2,002 = -$221, which is presented as ($221).\n\nSo the answer should be -221 or (221). The problem says \"net of deferred tax liabilities\", so it's assets minus liabilities, which is negative.\n\nIn the context of the problem, the answer is likely expected to be -221, but since the note uses parentheses, maybe (221). However, the instruction says \"in the correct financial format,\" and in financial statements, negative numbers are often in parentheses.\n\nBut the problem says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities,\" which is a bit confusing because it's a liability. But the calculation is clear.\n\nSo the final answer should be -221, but written as (221) or -221. Looking at the note, it's written as \"$ (221)\", so the answer should be (221).\n\nWait, but the question says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset\", which might be a mistake, but the calculation is based on the provided numbers.\n\nAnother check: the note says \"Net deferred tax liabilities $ (221) $ (304)\", so for 2024, it's (221). So the answer is (221).\n\nBut the problem says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities.\" If they're asking for the asset side, but the net is a liability, then the answer is a negative number. So the correct answer is -221, but in the format used in the note, it's (221).\n\nHowever, the instruction says \"in the correct financial format,\" and the note uses parentheses for negative numbers. So the answer should be (221).\n\nWait, but the question says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset,\" which might be a misnomer. The actual net position is a liability, so the answer is a negative number. But the problem might have a typo, and they just want the net deferred tax position.\n\nGiven that, the answer is (221) or -221. But looking at the note, it's presented as (221), so I'll go with that.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"net of deferred tax liabilities,\" so it's assets minus liabilities. If assets are 1,781 and liabilities are 2,002, then 1,781 - 2,002 = -221. So the answer is -221.\n\nIn the note, it's written as (221), which is the same as -221. So the answer should be -221.\n\nBut to confirm, let's see the exact wording in the note: \"Net deferred tax liabilities $ (221) $ (304)\". So the number is presented with parentheses, meaning negative.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be (221), but in the required format, perhaps as -221. However, the instruction says \"in the correct financial format,\" and financial statements use parentheses for negative numbers.\n\nBut the problem says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" So I think they expect (221) or -221. Given that the note uses parentheses, I'll use (221).\n\nWait, but the user's example in the instructions says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" Looking at the note, it's written as \"$ (221)\", so the number is 221 in parentheses.\n\nSo the answer should be (221).\n\nBut let me check once more. The question is \"Calculate Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities in 2024.\"\n\nThe note says \"Net deferred tax liabilities $ (221)\", so the answer is (221).\n\nYes, that's the number provided in the note. So the answer is (221).\n</think>\n\n<answer>:(221)</answer>",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to calculate the Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities for 2023 based on the provided financial statements. Let me carefully go through the context to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the financial statements, I see that Note 8 - Taxes has a section titled \"The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:\" which includes data for 2024 and 2023.\n\nFor 2023, the deferred tax assets section shows:\n- Equity compensation: $89\n- Deferred income/membership fees: $309\n- Foreign tax credit carry forward: $250\n- Operating lease liabilities: $678\n- Accrued liabilities and reserves: $761\n- Other: $20\nTotal deferred tax assets: $2,107\n\nThen, the deferred tax liabilities section shows:\n- Property and equipment: ($867)\n- Merchandise inventories: ($380)\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: ($655)\n- Foreign branch deferreds: ($87)\n- Other: ($0)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities: ($1,989)\n\nThe note also states: \"Total net deferred tax assets $1,685\" for 2023 (which is $2,107 - $422 valuation allowance = $1,685).\n\nBut the question asks for \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities\" specifically for 2023. I need to be careful here.\n\nLooking at the deferred tax assets, the \"Operating lease liabilities\" line item is $678 for 2023. This is likely the operating-related deferred tax asset.\n\nFor deferred tax liabilities, the \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" line item is $655 for 2023.\n\nThe question is asking for \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities\". This seems to be referring to the deferred tax asset related to operating lease liabilities, net of the deferred tax liability related to operating lease right-of-use assets.\n\nSo for 2023:\n- Operating lease liabilities deferred tax asset: $678\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets deferred tax liability: $655\n\nNet = $678 - $655 = $23\n\nBut let me double-check if this is what the question is asking for. The question says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities\". This could be interpreted as the net of all operating-related deferred tax items.\n\nHowever, looking at the context, the \"Operating lease liabilities\" line item in deferred tax assets and \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" in deferred tax liabilities are the only operating lease-related items. The other items (like equity compensation, deferred income, etc.) are not specifically \"operating\" in the context of the question.\n\nSo the calculation would be:\nOperating Deferred Tax Asset (from operating lease liabilities) = $678\nDeferred Tax Liability (from operating lease right-of-use assets) = $655\nNet = $678 - $655 = $23\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to interpret this. The note also says: \"The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.\"\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to directly answer the question. The question is specifically asking for \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities\", which likely refers to the operating lease items.\n\nLet me look at the exact wording in the question: \"Calculate Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities in 2023\"\n\nIn the context of financial statements, \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset\" typically refers to deferred tax assets related to operating activities, which would include items like operating lease liabilities. The \"net of deferred tax liabilities\" means we need to subtract the related deferred tax liabilities.\n\nSo for 2023:\n- Operating lease liabilities (deferred tax asset): $678\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets (deferred tax liability): $655\n- Net = $678 - $655 = $23\n\nThis seems to be the correct calculation. The other deferred tax items (like equity compensation, deferred income, etc.) are not specifically \"operating\" in the context of the question.\n\nLet me confirm with the numbers:\nFor 2023:\n- Operating lease liabilities: $678 (deferred tax asset)\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $655 (deferred tax liability)\n\nNet = $678 - $655 = $23\n\nSo the answer should be $23 million.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other operating-related deferred tax item. The \"Accrued liabilities and reserves\" line item is $761 for 2023, which might be considered operating, but the question specifically says \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset\", and the operating lease items are the most directly related to operating activities.\n\nThe note also says: \"Operating lease liabilities\" is a line item in deferred tax assets, and \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" is a line item in deferred tax liabilities. This seems to be the specific operating item they're referring to.\n\nSo I think $23 million is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities in 2023, I need to identify the relevant deferred tax items related to operating activities from the financial statements.\n\nFrom Note 8 - Taxes, the components of deferred tax assets and liabilities for 2023 are:\n\nDeferred Tax Assets (2023):\n- Operating lease liabilities: $678\n\nDeferred Tax Liabilities (2023):\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $655\n\nThe question specifically asks for the \"Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities,\" which refers to the net of the operating lease-related deferred tax items.\n\nCalculation:\nOperating Deferred Tax Asset (from operating lease liabilities) = $678\nDeferred Tax Liability (from operating lease right-of-use assets) = $655\nNet = $678 - $655 = $23\n\nThis matches the specific operating lease items mentioned in the deferred tax schedule.\n\n<answer>:23",

      "ground_truth": "24.30%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"What is the operating cash tax rate in 2024?\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the operating cash tax rate means. From my knowledge, the operating cash tax rate is calculated as the cash paid for income taxes divided by the income before taxes. This gives a measure of the actual tax paid in cash relative to the pre-tax income.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, I need to find two key figures for 2024:\n1. Cash paid for income taxes\n2. Income before income taxes\n\nFrom the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, under \"SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION,\" it states:\n\"Cash paid during the year for:\nInterest $ 129 $ 125 $ 145\nIncome taxes, net $ 2,319 $ 2,234 $ 1,940\"\n\nSo for 2024, the cash paid for income taxes is $2,319 million.\n\nNext, I need the income before income taxes for 2024. Looking at the Consolidated Statements of Income, under \"INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES,\" it shows $9,740 million for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024.\n\nNow, the operating cash tax rate is calculated as:\n(Cash paid for income taxes / Income before income taxes) × 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n($2,319 / $9,740) × 100\n\nLet me calculate that:\n2,319 ÷ 9,740 = 0.2380\n0.2380 × 100 = 23.80%\n\nSo the operating cash tax rate for 2024 is 23.80%.\n\nI should double-check if there's any other information that might affect this calculation. The note about \"Income taxes, net\" in the cash flow statement seems to be the correct figure to use for cash paid. The income before income taxes is clearly stated in the income statement.\n\nAlso, the effective tax rate in the notes shows 24.4% for 2024, which is close to our calculated 23.80%. The slight difference is because the effective tax rate is based on the provision for income taxes ($2,373 million) rather than cash paid ($2,319 million). But the question specifically asks for the operating cash tax rate, which uses cash paid, not the provision.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct. The operating cash tax rate is 23.80%.\n</think>\n\nThe operating cash tax rate is calculated as cash paid for income taxes divided by income before income taxes. From the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash paid for income taxes (net) in 2024 is $2,319 million.

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is to determine the Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding in 2024 for Costco Wholesale Corporation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"fully diluted shares outstanding\" means. It refers to the total number of shares that would be outstanding if all possible sources of dilution (like stock options, warrants, convertible bonds) were exercised or converted. However, in the context of financial statements, the fully diluted shares are usually provided in the income statement or equity section.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, I should check the Consolidated Statements of Income. The income statement has a section for \"Shares used in calculation (000’s)\" under the net income per common share. \n\nIn the income statement, there's a line for \"Diluted\" shares. For the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, the Diluted shares are listed as 444,759 (in thousands). The note says \"Shares used in calculation (000’s)\", so 444,759 thousand shares. \n\nWait, but the question asks for \"Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding\". In financial reporting, the diluted shares are the fully diluted shares. So the number provided under \"Diluted\" in the income statement should be the answer. \n\nLet me confirm. The income statement shows:\n\nBasic Shares: 443,914 (000's)\nDiluted Shares: 444,759 (000's)\n\nSo the fully diluted shares outstanding for 2024 would be 444,759,000 shares. But the question might want it in the same format as presented, which is in thousands. However, the answer should be in the correct financial format. Typically, when asked for shares outstanding, it's presented as a number, often in thousands or millions. But the problem says \"in the correct financial format\".\n\nLooking at the context, the shares are listed as \"444,759\" (000's), meaning 444,759 thousand shares. So the actual number is 444,759,000 shares. But the answer might need to be presented as 444,759 (since it's in thousands), but the question says \"Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding\", which is usually reported as the total number. However, in financial statements, they often present it in thousands. \n\nWait, the problem says \"provide the final answer in the required format\". The original context shows \"Diluted 444,759\" under Shares used in calculation (000's). So the answer should be 444,759,000, but perhaps they want it as 444,759 (since it's in thousands). But the standard way to report shares outstanding is the actual number, but in the financials, they present it in thousands. However, the question might expect the number as presented in the statement, which is 444,759 (thousand shares). \n\nWait, the instruction says \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\". In financial reports, when they say \"shares outstanding\", they often list the number as is, but here the statement specifies \"Shares used in calculation (000’s)\", so 444,759 means 444,759,000 shares. But the answer should probably be written as 444,759,000. However, looking at similar problems, sometimes they just take the number from the statement. \n\nWait, let me check the exact line. The income statement has:\n\nShares used in calculation (000’s)\nBasic 443,914\nDiluted 444,759\n\nSo \"Diluted\" here is the fully diluted shares, and it's in thousands. So the actual number is 444,759 * 1,000 = 444,759,000 shares. But the question might expect the answer as 444,759 (thousand), but the standard answer would be the total number. However, in the context of the problem, since the statement lists it as 444,759 (000's), the answer should be 444,759,000. But let's see if there's any other data that might affect this.\n\nWait, the Consolidated Balance Sheet shows \"Common stock... 443,126,000 shares issued and outstanding\" as of September 1, 2024. But that's the actual number of shares issued and outstanding, not the diluted. The diluted shares are higher because of potential dilution from options, etc. The diluted shares in the income statement (444,759 thousand) should be the fully diluted number.\n\nThe balance sheet shows 443,126,000 shares issued and outstanding. But the diluted shares in the income statement are 444,759 thousand, which is 444,759,000. The difference is due to the dilutive effect of stock options, RSUs, etc. So the fully diluted shares outstanding is 444,759,000.\n\nBut the problem says \"Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding in 2024\". The income statement's diluted shares are the correct figure. So the answer should be 444,759,000. However, sometimes in financial contexts, they present it as 444.76 million, but the question probably expects the number as per the statement.\n\nWait, the instruction says \"in the correct financial format\". The statement lists it as 444,759 (thousand), so the answer should be 444,759,000. But let's check if there's any other note that might adjust this.\n\nLooking at the Notes, Note 7 on Stock-Based Compensation mentions that there were 908,000 RSUs vested but not yet delivered as of the end of 2024. But the diluted shares already account for that, as the diluted shares are calculated using the treasury stock method, which includes the effect of dilutive securities. So the 444,759 thousand should already include those.\n\nTherefore, the fully diluted shares outstanding for 2024 is 444,759,000. But the problem might want it written as 444,759 (since it's in thousands), but the standard answer would be the actual number. However, in the context of the question, since the income statement lists it as 444,759 (000's), the answer should be 444,759,000.\n\nWait, but the question says \"Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding\", which is a standard term. The income statement's \"Diluted\" shares are exactly that. So the answer is 444,759,000. But let's confirm the number. The income statement for 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, under Diluted shares: 444,759 (000's). So 444,759 * 1,000 = 444,759,000.\n\nYes, so the final answer should be 444,759,000. But let's check if the problem expects it without commas. In financial contexts, sometimes they write it as 444759000, but usually with commas. However, the instruction says \"concise, in the correct financial format\". The standard way is to use commas as thousand separators.\n\nBut looking at the original context, the shares are listed as \"444,759\" (with commas), so the answer should be 444,759,000.\n\nWait, but the problem might just want the number as presented in the statement, which is 444,759 (thousand), so the answer is 444,759,000. However, sometimes in such questions, they just take the number from the statement without converting, but the question says \"Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding\", which is the actual number, not in thousands.\n\nAnother way: the balance sheet shows 443,126,000 shares issued and outstanding. The diluted shares are higher, so 444,759,000 is correct.\n\nYes, so the answer is 444,759,000.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:444,759,000",

      "question": "Calculate the Unlevered Beta for 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "0.77",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to calculate the Unlevered Beta for Costco in 2024. First, I need to recall what Unlevered Beta is. From what I remember, Unlevered Beta (also called Asset Beta) is the beta of a company without the effect of debt. It's calculated by taking the Levered Beta (which is the beta we usually see) and adjusting it for the company's capital structure.\n\nThe formula for Unlevered Beta is:  \nβ_unlevered = β_levered / [1 + (1 - tax rate) * (Debt/Equity)]\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't give me the Levered Beta directly. However, looking at the provided context, there's a line that says \"Beta: 0.79\". So I assume that's the Levered Beta (β_levered) for Costco.\n\nNext, I need to find the Debt/Equity ratio. From the financial statements, I should look at the balance sheet. Let me check the balance sheet for 2024.\n\nLooking at the Consolidated Balance Sheets for September 1, 2024:\n- Total Liabilities: $46,209 million\n- Total Equity: $23,622 million\n\nWait, but Debt is usually the interest-bearing debt, not total liabilities. The context mentions \"Long-Term Debt, excluding current portion\" as $5,794 million. Also, there's a current portion of long-term debt of $103 million. So total debt would be $5,794 + $103 = $5,897 million. But sometimes, short-term borrowings are included. The balance sheet shows \"Current portion of long-term debt\" as $103, and \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" as $5,794. So total debt is $5,897 million.\n\nBut wait, the context also says \"Short-Term Borrowings\" with a borrowing capacity of $1,198, but it says \"Short-term borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\" So probably, short-term debt is negligible. So total debt is approximately $5,897 million.\n\nEquity is $23,622 million (Total Equity).\n\nSo Debt/Equity = 5,897 / 23,622 ≈ 0.2496.\n\nNow, the tax rate. The context provides \"Provision for income taxes\" as $2,373 million and \"Income before income taxes\" as $9,740 million. So the tax rate would be 2,373 / 9,740 ≈ 0.2436 or 24.36%.\n\nBut wait, the problem might expect using the effective tax rate from the income statement. Let me confirm. The income tax provision is $2,373, and income before tax is $9,740, so tax rate is 2,373 / 9,740 ≈ 24.36%.\n\nNow, plug into the formula:\n\nβ_unlevered = β_levered / [1 + (1 - tax rate) * (Debt/Equity)]\n\nβ_levered = 0.79\n\ntax rate = 0.2436\n\nDebt/Equity = 5,897 / 23,622 ≈ 0.2496\n\nFirst, calculate (1 - tax rate) = 1 - 0.2436 = 0.7564\n\nThen, (1 - tax rate) * (Debt/Equity) = 0.7564 * 0.2496 ≈ 0.1888\n\nSo denominator = 1 + 0.1888 = 1.1888\n\nThen β_unlevered = 0.79 / 1.1888 ≈ 0.664\n\nWait, but let me check the numbers again.\n\nTotal Debt: Long-term debt excluding current portion is $5,794, current portion is $103, so total debt is $5,794 + $103 = $5,897 million.\n\nEquity: Total Equity is $23,622 million.\n\nDebt/Equity = 5,897 / 23,622 = let's compute that exactly: 5897 ÷ 23622 ≈ 0.2496.\n\nTax rate: 2373 / 9740 = 0.2436.\n\n(1 - tax rate) = 0.7564.\n\n(1 - tax rate) * (Debt/Equity) = 0.7564 * 0.2496 ≈ 0.1888.\n\n1 + 0.1888 = 1.1888.\n\n0.79 / 1.1888 ≈ 0.664.\n\nSo approximately 0.66.\n\nBut wait, sometimes the formula uses market value of debt and equity. However, the problem doesn't specify, and the context gives balance sheet numbers, so we'll use book values.\n\nAlso, the problem states \"Costco Stock Price: $940\", but I don't think that's needed for unlevered beta calculation. The beta given is probably the market beta.\n\nWait, the context says \"Beta: 0.79\", so that's the levered beta.\n\nAnother thing: sometimes the formula uses the debt-to-equity ratio as a market value, but since we don't have market values for debt, we'll use book values.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct.\n\nLet me check if the debt is correctly identified. The balance sheet shows \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" as $5,794, and \"Current portion of long-term debt\" as $103. So total debt is $5,897. The short-term borrowings are immaterial, so we can ignore them.\n\nEquity is $23,622.\n\nTax rate is 24.36%.\n\nSo the calculation should be:\n\nβ_unlevered = 0.79 / [1 + (1 - 0.2436) * (5897/23622)]\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n5897 / 23622 = 0.2496\n\n1 - 0.2436 = 0.7564\n\n0.7564 * 0.2496 = 0.1888\n\n1 + 0.1888 = 1.1888\n\n0.79 / 1.1888 = 0.664\n\nRounded to two decimal places, that's 0.66.\n\nBut sometimes, beta is reported to two decimal places. So 0.66.\n\nWait, but let me check if the tax rate should be the marginal tax rate or the effective tax rate. The problem gives the effective tax rate from the income statement, so that's correct.\n\nAnother point: the problem mentions \"Cost of Debt: 6%\". But for unlevered beta, we don't need the cost of debt, just the tax rate. So that's probably a red herring.\n\nAlso, the 10Y Treasury is 4.617% and Market Return is 11%, but those are for CAPM, not for unlevering beta. So irrelevant here.\n\nSo the answer should be approximately 0.66.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the formula. The standard formula for unlevering beta is:\n\nβ_u = β_l / [1 + (1 - T) * (D/E)]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo with the numbers plugged in, it's 0.79 / (1 + 0.7564 * 0.2496) = 0.79 / 1.1888 ≈ 0.664.\n\nRounded to two decimal places, 0.66.\n\nBut sometimes, it's kept to three decimal places. However, the problem says \"concise, in the correct financial format\". Beta is often reported to two decimal places.\n\nSo the final answer should be 0.66.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the Unlevered Beta for Costco in 2024, the formula used is:  \nβ_unlevered = β_levered / [1 + (1 - tax rate) × (Debt/Equity)]  \n\nGiven:  \n- Levered Beta (β_levered) = 0.79  \n- Total Debt (Long-term debt + Current portion) = $5,794 + $103 = $5,897 million  \n- Equity = $23,622 million  \n- Debt/Equity = $5,897 / $23,622 ≈ 0.2496  \n- Tax rate = Provision for income taxes / Income before income taxes = $2,373 / $9,740 ≈ 24.36% (0.2436)  \n\nCalculation:  \n(1 - tax rate) = 1 - 0.2436 = 0.7564  \n(1 - tax rate) × (Debt/Equity) = 0.7564 × 0.2496 ≈ 0.1888  \nDenominator = 1 + 0.1888 = 1.1888  \nβ_unlevered = 0.79 / 1.1888 ≈ 0.664  \n\nRounded to two decimal places, the Unlevered Beta is 0.66.  \n\n<answer>:0.66",

      "question": "Compute Debt for 2024. Include Debt Equivalents.",
      "ground_truth": "$11,415 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to compute Costco's debt for 2024, including debt equivalents. Let me look through the provided financial statements to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll check the Consolidated Balance Sheets for 2024. On the liabilities side, I see:\n\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\n\nSo total debt (without equivalents) would be $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million.\n\nBut the question asks for \"Debt Equivalents,\" which typically refers to lease liabilities. Looking at Note 5 on Leases, I see:\n\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,617 million (2024)\n- Operating lease liabilities: $2,375 million (long-term) + $179 million (current) = $2,554 million\n\nAlso, there are finance lease liabilities:\n- Finance lease liabilities: $1,351 million (long-term) + $147 million (current) = $1,498 million\n\nThe question says \"Debt Equivalents,\" which usually means lease liabilities. In financial analysis, lease liabilities are often treated as debt equivalents.\n\nSo total debt equivalents would be operating lease liabilities + finance lease liabilities = $2,554 + $1,498 = $4,052 million.\n\nNow, total debt including equivalents would be:\n- Total debt (from balance sheet): $5,897 million\n- Debt equivalents (lease liabilities): $4,052 million\n- Total: $5,897 + $4,052 = $9,949 million\n\nWait, but I should check if the lease liabilities are already included in the debt figures. Looking at the balance sheet, the lease liabilities are reported separately under \"Other Liabilities\" as:\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375 million\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576 million (which includes other items)\n\nThe lease liabilities are not included in the debt figures. So I need to add them as equivalents.\n\nLet me verify the lease liability numbers from Note 5:\n\nOperating lease liabilities:\n- Current: $179 million\n- Long-term: $2,375 million\n- Total: $2,554 million\n\nFinance lease liabilities:\n- Current: $147 million\n- Long-term: $1,351 million\n- Total: $1,498 million\n\nTotal lease liabilities: $2,554 + $1,498 = $4,052 million\n\nNow, the debt figures from the balance sheet:\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\n- Total debt: $5,897 million\n\nSo total debt including equivalents = $5,897 + $4,052 = $9,949 million\n\nBut I should check if there's any other debt equivalents. The notes mention \"Other long-term debt\" which includes the Japanese subsidiary's Guaranteed Senior Notes, but that's already included in the long-term debt figure.\n\nAlso, the \"Debt Equivalents\" typically refers to lease liabilities, so I think $4,052 million is the correct amount to add.\n\nLet me double-check the balance sheet:\n\nLiabilities and Equity:\n- Current Liabilities: $35,464 million\n- Other Liabilities: $10,745 million (which includes long-term debt, operating lease liabilities, etc.)\n\nSpecifically:\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375 million\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576 million\n\nSo the lease liabilities are already reported separately, and we need to add them as equivalents.\n\nTherefore, total debt including equivalents = total debt + lease liabilities = $5,897 + $4,052 = $9,949 million.\n\nWait, but the lease liabilities are already part of the \"Other Liabilities\" section. The question asks for \"Debt Equivalents,\" which means we need to add the lease liabilities to the debt figure.\n\nSo the calculation should be:\n- Debt (from balance sheet): $5,897 million\n- Debt equivalents (lease liabilities): $4,052 million\n- Total: $9,949 million\n\nI think that's correct. Let me confirm with the numbers:\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794\n- Total debt: $5,897\n\nFrom Note 5:\n- Operating lease liabilities: $2,554 (current $179 + long-term $2,375)\n- Finance lease liabilities: $1,498 (current $147 + long-term $1,351)\n- Total lease liabilities: $4,052\n\nSo total debt including equivalents = $5,897 + $4,052 = $9,949 million.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me make sure I'm not double-counting. The lease liabilities are not included in the debt figure, so adding them as equivalents is correct.\n\nFinal answer: $9,949 million\n</think>\n\nTo compute Costco's debt for 2024 including debt equivalents (lease liabilities), I need to sum the total debt from the balance sheet and the lease liabilities from Note 5.\n\nFrom the Consolidated Balance Sheets (2024):\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\n- Total debt = $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million\n\nFrom Note 5 (Leases):\n- Operating lease liabilities (current + long-term): $179 + $2,375 = $2,554 million\n- Finance lease liabilities (current + long-term): $147 + $1,351 = $1,498 million\n- Total lease liabilities (debt equivalents) = $2,554 + $1,498 = $4,052 million\n\nTotal debt including equivalents = Total debt + Debt equivalents = $5,897 + $4,052 = $9,949 million\n\n<answer>:9,949",

      "ground_truth": "$271 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to compute the Net Debt for Costco for 2024 based on the provided financial statements. Let me recall what Net Debt typically means in financial terms. Net Debt is usually calculated as Total Debt minus Cash and Cash Equivalents. Sometimes it's adjusted for other items, but the standard formula is Total Debt - Cash.\n\nFirst, I need to find the Total Debt and Cash and Cash Equivalents from the balance sheet for 2024.\n\nLooking at the Consolidated Balance Sheets for September 1, 2024:\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $9,906 million\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\n\nSo Total Debt would be the sum of the current portion and long-term debt. That's $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million.\n\nNow, Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents = $5,897 - $9,906.\n\nWait, that would give a negative number. But Net Debt can be negative if cash exceeds debt, which is possible for companies with strong cash positions.\n\nLet me double-check the numbers:\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $9,906 million (from the balance sheet)\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n- Long-term debt (excluding current portion): $5,794 million\n\nTotal Debt = $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million.\n\nNet Debt = $5,897 - $9,906 = -$4,009 million.\n\nBut I should confirm if there are any other debt components. The balance sheet shows \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" as $5,794, and \"Current portion of long-term debt\" as $103. So total debt is indeed $5,897.\n\nAlso, note that the balance sheet lists \"Short-term borrowings\" as immaterial, so we don't need to include that.\n\nAnother thing to consider: sometimes Net Debt is calculated as Total Debt minus Cash and Short-term Investments. But the standard is usually just Cash and Cash Equivalents. However, in some contexts, they might include short-term investments. Let me check the balance sheet.\n\nThe balance sheet shows \"Short-term investments\" as $1,238 million for 2024. But typically, Net Debt uses Cash and Cash Equivalents, not including short-term investments. However, to be thorough, I should check if the problem specifies.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify, so I'll stick with the standard definition: Total Debt minus Cash and Cash Equivalents.\n\nSo, using the numbers:\n\nTotal Debt = Current portion + Long-term debt = $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents = $9,906 million\n\nNet Debt = $5,897 - $9,906 = -$4,009 million\n\nBut let me check if there's any other debt. The balance sheet also lists \"Operating lease liabilities\" but those are not debt; they're lease obligations. So we don't include those in debt for Net Debt calculation.\n\nAlso, the \"Other long-term liabilities\" include things like deferred tax liabilities, which aren't debt. So only the debt items are the current portion and long-term debt.\n\nAnother point: the balance sheet shows \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" as $5,794, and \"Current portion of long-term debt\" as $103. So total debt is $5,897.\n\nNow, the cash is $9,906, so Net Debt is negative.\n\nBut let me confirm the exact figures from the balance sheet:\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $9,906 million\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\n\nYes, so total debt is $5,897 million.\n\nNet Debt = $5,897 - $9,906 = -$4,009 million.\n\nIn financial contexts, Net Debt is often reported as a negative number when cash exceeds debt, indicating a net cash position.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects a positive number or if I'm missing something.\n\nWait, sometimes Net Debt is calculated as Total Debt minus Cash and Cash Equivalents, but sometimes it's Total Debt minus Cash and Short-term Investments. Let me see if the problem specifies.\n\nThe problem says \"Compute Net Debt for 2024.\" Without additional context, the standard formula is Total Debt - Cash.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's see if the balance sheet has any other debt items. The \"Other long-term debt\" is part of the long-term debt, but in the balance sheet, it's included in the \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" line. The note 4 says \"Long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes,\" and the breakdown shows the total long-term debt excluding current portion as $5,794.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAnother way to check: the cash is $9,906, and debt is $5,897, so net cash is $4,009 million, meaning Net Debt is -$4,009 million.\n\nBut in some contexts, they might report it as a positive number with \"Net Cash\" instead of Net Debt. However, the question specifically asks for Net Debt.\n\nSo, the answer should be -$4,009 million.\n\nBut let me check the numbers again to be sure.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $9,906\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794\n\nTotal debt = 103 + 5,794 = 5,897\n\nNet Debt = 5,897 - 9,906 = -4,009\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the problem says \"in the correct financial format.\" So probably as a negative number, or sometimes they write it as \"Net Debt: ($4,009) million\" but since it's negative, it's fine.\n\nBut let me see if there's any other component. For example, sometimes Net Debt includes other liabilities, but no, standard is debt minus cash.\n\nAlso, the balance sheet shows \"Short-term investments\" as $1,238, but that's not part of cash for this calculation. Cash and Cash Equivalents is $9,906, which includes cash and equivalents, but not short-term investments. So we don't add that.\n\nSo, I think the answer is -$4,009 million.\n\nBut let me check the exact numbers from the balance sheet:\n\n\"Current Liabilities: Current portion of long-term debt $103\"\n\n\"Other Liabilities: Long-term debt, excluding current portion $5,794\"\n\nSo total debt is $5,897.\n\nCash and cash equivalents: $9,906.\n\nNet Debt = $5,897 - $9,906 = -$4,009.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final answer should be -$4,009 million.\n\nBut in financial reporting, sometimes they present it as a positive number with \"Net Cash\" but the question says \"Net Debt,\" so negative is correct.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\nTo compute Net Debt for 2024, use the standard formula:  \n**Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents**  \n\nFrom the Consolidated Balance Sheets (September 1, 2024):  \n- **Total Debt** = Current portion of long-term debt + Long-term debt (excluding current portion)  \n  = $103 million + $5,794 million = **$5,897 million**  \n- **Cash and Cash Equivalents** = **$9,906 million**  \n\nNet Debt = $5,897 million - $9,906 million = **-$4,009 million**  \n\nThis negative value indicates Costco holds more cash than total debt, resulting in a net cash position.  \n\n<answer>-$4,009</answer>",

      "question": "What is the Book Value of Equity in 2024?",
      "ground_truth": "$23,622 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about the Book Value of Equity for Costco in 2024. First, I need to recall what Book Value of Equity means. It's the total equity of a company as reported on the balance sheet, which is typically calculated as total assets minus total liabilities.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, specifically the Consolidated Balance Sheets for September 1, 2024, and September 3, 2023. The question asks for 2024, so I should focus on the September 1, 2024, figures.\n\nIn the Balance Sheets section, under Equity, the Total Equity is listed as $23,622 million. Let me double-check that. The line items under Equity are:\n\n- Preferred stock: $0 (not applicable)\n- Common stock: $2\n- Additional paid-in capital: $7,829\n- Accumulated other comprehensive loss: ($1,828)\n- Retained earnings: $17,619\n\nAdding those up: $2 + $7,829 = $7,831; $7,831 - $1,828 = $6,003; $6,003 + $17,619 = $23,622. That matches the Total Equity figure provided.\n\nThe Consolidated Statements of Equity also confirms the ending balance for September 1, 2024, as $23,622 million. So the Book Value of Equity for 2024 is $23,622 million.\n\nI should make sure there's no trick here. Sometimes questions might ask for per share or something else, but the question specifically says \"Book Value of Equity,\" which is the total equity. The context provided includes the balance sheet where Total Equity is clearly stated. No need to calculate it from assets minus liabilities since it's directly given. The total assets are $69,831 million, total liabilities are $46,209 million, so $69,831 - $46,209 = $23,622 million. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo the answer should be $23,622 million. The question asks for the answer in the correct financial format, so I'll present it as 23,622 (in millions, as per the context's note that amounts are in millions except per share data).\n</think>\n\nThe Book Value of Equity is calculated as Total Equity from the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For September 1, 2024, the Total Equity line item is explicitly listed as $23,622 million. This is confirmed by the sum of equity components: Common Stock ($2), Additional Paid-in Capital ($7,829), Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss ($1,828), and Retained Earnings ($17,619), totaling $23,622 million.\n\n<answer>:23,622",

      "question": "Calculate ROIC for 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "25.33%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to calculate ROIC for Costco for 2024. Let me recall what ROIC stands for—it's Return on Invested Capital. The formula is Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT) divided by Invested Capital.\n\nFirst, I need to find NOPAT. NOPAT is calculated as Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) multiplied by (1 - Tax Rate). But looking at the financial statements, I see Operating Income is $9,285 million. Since Operating Income is before interest and taxes, that's essentially EBIT. So EBIT = $9,285 million.\n\nNext, I need the tax rate. The Provision for Income Taxes is $2,373 million, and Income Before Income Taxes is $9,740 million. So the tax rate would be Provision / Income Before Taxes = 2,373 / 9,740 ≈ 0.2436 or 24.36%.\n\nTherefore, NOPAT = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) = 9,285 * (1 - 0.2436) = 9,285 * 0.7564 ≈ $7,028 million. Let me verify that calculation: 9,285 * 0.7564. Let's compute it: 9,285 * 0.75 = 6,963.75, and 9,285 * 0.0064 ≈ 59.424, so total ≈ 7,023.174. Hmm, maybe better to use exact numbers. 2,373 / 9,740 = 0.2436, so 1 - 0.2436 = 0.7564. 9,285 * 0.7564 = let's calculate: 9,285 * 0.7 = 6,499.5; 9,285 * 0.05 = 464.25; 9,285 * 0.0064 = 59.424; total 6,499.5 + 464.25 = 6,963.75 + 59.424 = 7,023.174. So approximately $7,023 million.\n\nNow, Invested Capital. Invested Capital is typically Total Assets minus Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities. But sometimes it's calculated as Total Assets minus Current Liabilities minus Cash and Cash Equivalents. Let me check the standard formula.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, Total Assets as of September 1, 2024, are $69,831 million. Current Liabilities are $35,464 million. Cash and Cash Equivalents are $9,906 million. So Invested Capital = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Cash and Cash Equivalents.\n\nWait, but sometimes it's Total Assets minus Current Liabilities minus Excess Cash. The standard formula for Invested Capital is:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nBut I need to confirm. Alternatively, it's often calculated as:\n\nInvested Capital = Debt + Equity - Excess Cash\n\nBut in this case, since we have the balance sheet, the common approach is:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nLet me verify with the numbers.\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831 million\n\nCurrent Liabilities: $35,464 million\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents: $9,906 million\n\nSo Invested Capital = 69,831 - 35,464 - 9,906 = let's compute:\n\n69,831 - 35,464 = 34,367\n\n34,367 - 9,906 = 24,461 million\n\nWait, but sometimes it's Total Assets minus Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities. Current Liabilities include accounts payable, accrued salaries, etc., which are non-interest-bearing. So subtracting all current liabilities and cash makes sense.\n\nAnother way: Invested Capital = (Total Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Short-Term Debt)\n\nBut in this case, the current liabilities include accounts payable, accrued items, etc., which are non-interest-bearing. Short-term debt is part of current liabilities, but in the balance sheet, the current portion of long-term debt is $103 million, which is part of current liabilities. So perhaps it's better to use the standard formula.\n\nLooking at the financials, the company has a current portion of long-term debt of $103 million, which is interest-bearing. So to get non-interest-bearing current liabilities, we might need to subtract that. But the standard approach for ROIC is to subtract all current liabilities and cash, as the interest-bearing debt is already accounted for in the cost of capital.\n\nWait, actually, the correct formula for Invested Capital is:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash\n\nBut to simplify, many use:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Cash\n\nBecause Current Liabilities include both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing, but the interest-bearing part is small. However, in this case, the current liabilities include the current portion of long-term debt ($103 million), which is interest-bearing. So to be precise, we should subtract only non-interest-bearing current liabilities.\n\nBut for simplicity, and since the interest-bearing portion is small, many analysts use Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Cash.\n\nLet me check the numbers again.\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831\n\nCurrent Liabilities: $35,464\n\nCash: $9,906\n\nSo 69,831 - 35,464 = 34,367\n\n34,367 - 9,906 = 24,461\n\nBut let's see if there's a better way. Another common formula is:\n\nInvested Capital = Debt + Equity - Excess Cash\n\nDebt: Long-term debt excluding current portion is $5,794 million, plus current portion $103 million, so total debt = 5,794 + 103 = $5,897 million.\n\nEquity: Total Equity is $23,622 million.\n\nExcess Cash: Cash and Cash Equivalents minus target cash. But since we don't have a target, we'll use all cash.\n\nSo Invested Capital = Debt + Equity - Cash = 5,897 + 23,622 - 9,906 = 5,897 + 23,622 = 29,519; 29,519 - 9,906 = 19,613 million.\n\nWait, that's different from the previous calculation. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the standard formula for Invested Capital in ROIC is:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash\n\nBut to avoid confusion, let's look at the context. In the financial statements, the company has operating lease right-of-use assets, which are part of the assets. But for ROIC, we usually include all assets used in operations.\n\nAnother approach: Invested Capital = Operating Assets - Operating Liabilities\n\nOperating Assets = Total Assets - Non-Operating Assets (like investments)\n\nBut in this case, the company has short-term investments of $1,238 million. So perhaps we need to subtract that.\n\nWait, the balance sheet shows:\n\nCurrent Assets: $34,246 million\n\nWhich includes Cash $9,906, Short-term investments $1,238, Receivables $2,721, Merchandise inventories $18,647, Other current assets $1,734.\n\nSo non-operating assets might be the short-term investments. So Operating Assets = Total Assets - Short-term investments.\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831\n\nShort-term investments: $1,238\n\nSo Operating Assets = 69,831 - 1,238 = 68,593\n\nOperating Liabilities: Current Liabilities - Short-term debt (if any). Current Liabilities include accounts payable, accrued items, etc. The current portion of long-term debt is $103 million, which is interest-bearing. So non-interest-bearing current liabilities = Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 35,464 - 103 = 35,361\n\nThen Invested Capital = Operating Assets - Operating Liabilities = 68,593 - 35,361 = 33,232\n\nBut that seems high. Let me check another source.\n\nI recall that for ROIC, the formula is:\n\nROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital\n\nWhere Invested Capital = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Cash\n\nBut let's see what the standard is. In many textbooks, Invested Capital is calculated as:\n\nInvested Capital = (Total Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Short-Term Debt)\n\nBut in this case, Short-Term Debt is part of current liabilities. The current liabilities include \"Current portion of long-term debt\" $103 million, which is a short-term debt. So Current Liabilities - Short-Term Debt = 35,464 - 103 = 35,361\n\nTotal Assets - Cash = 69,831 - 9,906 = 59,925\n\nThen Invested Capital = 59,925 - 35,361 = 24,564\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nInvested Capital = Debt + Equity - Cash\n\nDebt = Long-term debt + Current portion = 5,794 + 103 = 5,897\n\nEquity = Total Equity = 23,622\n\nSo Debt + Equity = 5,897 + 23,622 = 29,519\n\nInvested Capital = 29,519 - 9,906 = 19,613\n\nBut I think the first method is more common. Let me check the company's own disclosures. However, since this is a problem, I need to use standard financial ratios.\n\nLooking back at the problem, the user provided the financial statements, so I should use the standard approach.\n\nAnother way: In the context of the problem, they might expect the simple formula: Invested Capital = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Cash.\n\nSo:\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831\n\nCurrent Liabilities: $35,464\n\nCash: $9,906\n\nInvested Capital = 69,831 - 35,464 - 9,906 = 24,461\n\nNow, NOPAT: We have EBIT = Operating Income = $9,285 million\n\nTax Rate = Provision / Income Before Taxes = 2,373 / 9,740 ≈ 24.36%\n\nNOPAT = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) = 9,285 * (1 - 0.2436) = 9,285 * 0.7564 ≈ 7,023 million\n\nSo ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital = 7,023 / 24,461 ≈ 0.2871 or 28.71%\n\nBut let's compute it more accurately.\n\nFirst, Tax Rate = 2,373 / 9,740 = 0.243634\n\n1 - Tax Rate = 0.756366\n\nNOPAT = 9,285 * 0.756366 = let's calculate:\n\n9,285 * 0.756366\n\nFirst, 9,285 * 0.7 = 6,499.5\n\n9,285 * 0.05 = 464.25\n\n9,285 * 0.006 = 55.71\n\n9,285 * 0.000366 ≈ 9,285 * 0.0003 = 2.7855; 9,285 * 0.000066 ≈ 0.6128; total ≈ 3.3983\n\nSo total NOPAT ≈ 6,499.5 + 464.25 = 6,963.75 + 55.71 = 7,019.46 + 3.3983 ≈ 7,022.86 million\n\nInvested Capital = 69,831 - 35,464 - 9,906 = 69,831 - 45,370 = 24,461\n\nROIC = 7,022.86 / 24,461 ≈ 0.2871 or 28.71%\n\nBut let's check if the company uses a different definition. Sometimes ROIC is calculated using average invested capital, but the problem doesn't specify, so we'll use the ending balance.\n\nAnother point: The Operating Income is $9,285, but is that the correct EBIT? Yes, because Operating Income is before interest and taxes.\n\nAlso, the Provision for Income Taxes is $2,373, so the tax rate is correct.\n\nNow, let's confirm the Invested Capital. I recall that in some cases, for companies with significant operating leases, we need to adjust for that. The company has operating lease right-of-use assets of $2,617 million. But in the balance sheet, these are included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" under Other Assets. So when we calculate Total Assets, it's already included. So the standard formula should be fine.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's see if the operating lease affects the calculation. The operating lease liabilities are $2,375 million (long-term) + $179 million (current) = $2,554 million. But for ROIC, we usually don't adjust for operating leases because they are already reflected in the assets and liabilities.\n\nSo I think the calculation is correct.\n\nNow, let's compute the exact numbers.\n\nNOPAT = Operating Income * (1 - Tax Rate) = 9,285 * (1 - 2,373/9,740)\n\nCompute 2,373/9,740 = 0.243634\n\n1 - 0.243634 = 0.756366\n\n9,285 * 0.756366 = let's do 9,285 * 0.756366\n\nCalculate 9,285 * 0.756366:\n\nFirst, 9,285 * 0.7 = 6,499.5\n\n9,285 * 0.05 = 464.25\n\n9,285 * 0.006 = 55.71\n\n9,285 * 0.0003 = 2.7855\n\n9,285 * 0.00006 = 0.5571\n\n9,285 * 0.000006 = 0.05571\n\nSo adding up:\n\n6,499.5 (0.7)\n\n+464.25 (0.05) = 6,963.75\n\n+55.71 (0.006) = 7,019.46\n\n+2.7855 (0.0003) = 7,022.2455\n\n+0.5571 (0.00006) = 7,022.8026\n\n+0.05571 (0.000006) ≈ 7,022.8583\n\nSo NOPAT ≈ $7,022.86 million\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Cash\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831\n\nCurrent Liabilities: $35,464\n\nCash: $9,906\n\nSo 69,831 - 35,464 = 34,367\n\n34,367 - 9,906 = 24,461\n\nROIC = 7,022.86 / 24,461 ≈ 0.2871 or 28.71%\n\nRounded to two decimal places, 28.71%.\n\nBut let's check if the problem expects a different calculation. Sometimes ROIC is calculated using EBIT after tax, which is NOPAT, divided by invested capital.\n\nAnother point: The company has a significant amount of short-term investments. Should we exclude those from assets? In the Invested Capital calculation, we usually exclude non-operating assets. Short-term investments are non-operating, so perhaps we should subtract them.\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831\n\nShort-term investments: $1,238\n\nSo Operating Assets = 69,831 - 1,238 = 68,593\n\nCurrent Liabilities: $35,464 (includes interest-bearing debt)\n\nBut to get non-interest-bearing current liabilities, subtract the interest-bearing portion. The current portion of long-term debt is $103 million, which is interest-bearing. So non-interest-bearing current liabilities = 35,464 - 103 = 35,361\n\nThen Invested Capital = Operating Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities = 68,593 - 35,361 = 33,232\n\nThen ROIC = 7,022.86 / 33,232 ≈ 0.2113 or 21.13%\n\nBut this is different. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the standard approach for ROIC in most financial analysis is to use:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Cash\n\nBecause the current liabilities include both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing, but the interest-bearing part is small, and it's common to use this simplified method.\n\nMoreover, in the context of the problem, since it's a straightforward calculation, they likely expect the simple method.\n\nLet me check online for Costco's ROIC. But since I can't, I'll stick to the standard.\n\nAnother way: The company's balance sheet shows \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" as $2,617 million. But these are part of the assets, so they are included in Total Assets.\n\nI think the first method is correct.\n\nLet's see what the numbers give.\n\nIf I use Invested Capital = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Cash = 24,461\n\nNOPAT = 7,023\n\nROIC = 7,023 / 24,461 = 0.2871 or 28.71%\n\nNow, let's see if the problem provides any hints. The user mentioned \"Calculate ROIC for 2024\", and the context is the financial statements.\n\nIn the financial statements, the Operating Income is $9,285, which is EBIT.\n\nThe Provision for Income Taxes is $2,373, so the tax rate is 2,373 / 9,740 = 24.36%.\n\nNOPAT = 9,285 * (1 - 0.2436) = 7,023.\n\nFor Invested Capital, the common formula in textbooks is:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Cash\n\nSo 69,831 - 35,464 - 9,906 = 24,461.\n\nThus, ROIC = 7,023 / 24,461 = 0.2871 or 28.71%.\n\nRounded to two decimal places, 28.71%.\n\nBut let's confirm the calculation:\n\n7,023 ÷ 24,461 = ?\n\n24,461 * 0.287 = 24,461 * 0.2 = 4,892.2; 24,461 * 0.08 = 1,956.88; 24,461 * 0.007 = 171.227; total 4,892.2 + 1,956.88 = 6,849.08 + 171.227 = 7,020.307, which is very close to 7,023. So 0.2871 is accurate.\n\nSo ROIC is approximately 28.71%.\n\nNow, the problem says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\". So probably as a percentage, rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut let's see if there's a standard rounding. Sometimes it's to one decimal, but two is common.\n\nAnother point: Some sources use average invested capital, but since the problem doesn't specify, we use the ending balance.\n\nSo the answer should be 28.71%.\n\nWait, but let's check if the company's own reports use a different method. For example, sometimes they use EBITDA or other metrics, but ROIC is specifically NOPAT over invested capital.\n\nI think 28.71% is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the NOPAT calculation.\n\nIncome Before Income Taxes: $9,740\n\nProvision for Income Taxes: $2,373\n\nSo Net Income: $7,367\n\nBut NOPAT is EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate), not Net Income.\n\nEBIT is Operating Income: $9,285\n\nTax Rate = Provision / Income Before Taxes = 2,373 / 9,740 = 0.2436\n\nSo NOPAT = 9,285 * (1 - 0.2436) = 9,285 * 0.7564 = 7,023 (as before)\n\nYes.\n\nInvested Capital: 24,461\n\nROIC = 7,023 / 24,461 = 0.2871 = 28.71%\n\nSo the final answer should be 28.71%.\n\nBut let's see if the problem expects it without the percent sign, or as a decimal. The instruction says \"in the correct financial format\", so probably as a percentage with two decimals.\n\nSo 28.71%\n\nNow, to confirm, I recall that Costco is a high-return company, and 28% ROIC is plausible for a strong company like Costco.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) for Costco for 2024, the formula used is:\n\n**ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital**\n\nWhere:\n- **NOPAT** = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate)\n- **Invested Capital** = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Cash\n\n**Step 1: Calculate NOPAT**\n- EBIT (Operating Income) = $9,285 million\n- Income Before Income Taxes = $9,740 million\n- Provision for Income Taxes = $2,373 million\n- Tax Rate = $2,373 / $9,740 = 24.36%\n- NOPAT = $9,285 × (1 - 0.2436) = $7,023 million\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Invested Capital**\n- Total Assets (Sep 1, 2024) = $69,831 million\n- Current Liabilities = $35,464 million\n- Cash and Cash Equivalents = $9,906 million\n- Invested Capital = $69,831 - $35,464 - $9,906 = $24,461 million\n\n**Step 3: Calculate ROIC**\n- ROIC = $7,023 / $24,461 = 0.2871 or **28.71%**\n\n<answer>:28.71%",

      "ground_truth": "$29,239 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is to determine the Invested Capital including Goodwill for 2024, using 2% of revenue as the max potential operating cash.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Invested Capital typically includes. From what I remember, Invested Capital is usually calculated as Total Assets minus Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities. But sometimes it's defined as Equity plus Debt minus Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities. Wait, but the problem mentions \"including Goodwill,\" so I need to make sure Goodwill is part of the calculation.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, the balance sheet for September 1, 2024 (which is the end of 2024), the total assets are $69,831 million. Goodwill is mentioned in Note 10 (Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets), and the balance sheet shows \"Other long-term assets\" as $3,936 million. But the goodwill specifically is listed in the segment report as $953 million for the US, $26 for Canada, $15 for Other International, totaling $994 million. Wait, the balance sheet lists \"Other long-term assets\" as $3,936, which includes goodwill. So the goodwill amount is part of that $3,936.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Invested Capital including Goodwill,\" so I need to include goodwill in the calculation. But how is Invested Capital calculated here? The standard formula for Invested Capital is:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nBut sometimes it's also calculated as:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Debt + Total Equity - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nBut the problem mentions \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" Hmm, maybe that's a red herring or part of the calculation. Wait, the instruction says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" Wait, but the question is to determine Invested Capital including Goodwill. Maybe the 2% is a distractor, or perhaps it's part of the calculation for something else. Wait, no, the problem states \"Determine Invested Capital including Goodwill for 2024, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" Wait, maybe the 2% is a typo or misdirection. Let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal Question: Determine Invested Capital including Goodwill for 2024, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\n\nWait, but Invested Capital is typically not calculated using a percentage of revenue. Maybe the \"max potential operating cash\" is a hint to adjust for something, but I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's get the necessary numbers from the balance sheet.\n\nTotal Assets as of September 1, 2024: $69,831 million (from the Consolidated Balance Sheets).\n\nNow, Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities (NIBCL) would include accounts payable, accrued liabilities, etc., that don't bear interest. But the problem says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash,\" which might be a way to adjust for operating cash, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe \"max potential operating cash\" refers to the maximum cash that could be generated from operations, but I'm not sure how that factors into Invested Capital.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is misphrased, and \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash\" is a separate instruction, but the main task is to calculate Invested Capital including Goodwill. Let's proceed with standard Invested Capital calculation.\n\nStandard Invested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nBut sometimes it's Total Assets - Current Liabilities (excluding interest-bearing debt). Wait, the current liabilities include accounts payable, accrued salaries, etc., which are non-interest-bearing. The interest-bearing debt would be the current portion of long-term debt and short-term borrowings.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, Current Liabilities are $35,464 million. But some of these are interest-bearing. The current portion of long-term debt is $103 million (from the balance sheet: \"Current portion of long-term debt 103 1,081\"). So the interest-bearing current liabilities would be the current portion of long-term debt, which is $103 million. The rest of the current liabilities are non-interest-bearing.\n\nSo Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities (NIBCL) = Total Current Liabilities - Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nTotal Current Liabilities = $35,464 million\n\nInterest-Bearing Current Liabilities = Current portion of long-term debt = $103 million\n\nTherefore, NIBCL = 35,464 - 103 = $35,361 million\n\nThen, Invested Capital = Total Assets - NIBCL = 69,831 - 35,361 = $34,470 million\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"including Goodwill.\" Goodwill is part of Total Assets, so it's already included. So the calculation above should include goodwill.\n\nBut let's verify if there's another way. Sometimes Invested Capital is calculated as Equity + Debt - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities. Let's check that.\n\nTotal Liabilities and Equity = $69,831 million (matches Total Assets)\n\nTotal Liabilities = $46,209 million (from the balance sheet: \"TOTAL LIABILITIES 46,209 43,936\")\n\nTotal Equity = $23,622 million\n\nDebt would be Total Liabilities minus Non-Interest-Bearing Liabilities. Wait, but Debt is usually interest-bearing debt.\n\nInterest-bearing debt includes long-term debt (excluding current portion) and current portion of long-term debt. From the balance sheet:\n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\n\nSo Total Interest-Bearing Debt = 103 + 5,794 = $5,897 million\n\nTotal Liabilities = $46,209 million\n\nNon-Interest-Bearing Liabilities = Total Liabilities - Interest-Bearing Debt = 46,209 - 5,897 = $40,312 million\n\nBut Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities (NIBCL) would be part of Non-Interest-Bearing Liabilities. Wait, maybe the standard formula is:\n\nInvested Capital = (Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities) = (Total Liabilities + Equity) - (Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities)\n\nBut I think the first method is correct.\n\nWait, another way: Invested Capital = Total Assets - (Current Liabilities - Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities)\n\nWhich is the same as Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities.\n\nSo using that:\n\nTotal Assets = $69,831\n\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nCurrent Liabilities = $35,464\n\nInterest-Bearing Current Liabilities = Current portion of long-term debt = $103\n\nSo NIBCL = 35,464 - 103 = 35,361\n\nInvested Capital = 69,831 - 35,361 = 34,470\n\nBut the problem mentions \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" Wait, maybe this is a hint that we need to adjust the operating cash or something else. Let's check the revenue.\n\nTotal Revenue for 2024 is $254,453 million (from the Income Statement: \"Total revenue 254,453 242,290 226,954\")\n\n2% of revenue would be 0.02 * 254,453 = $5,089.06 million.\n\nBut how does this relate to Invested Capital? Maybe the \"max potential operating cash\" is a way to say that we should use 2% of revenue as the operating cash, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the question is miswritten, and the \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash\" is part of the Invested Capital calculation, but I don't recall that being standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for Invested Capital including Goodwill, and the 2% is a red herring. Let's see if the answer is supposed to be adjusted by that 2%.\n\nWait, another thought: Sometimes in some contexts, Invested Capital is calculated as Equity + Debt - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities. Let's try that.\n\nEquity = $23,622 million\n\nDebt = Total Interest-Bearing Debt = $5,897 million (as calculated before)\n\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities = $35,361 million\n\nSo Invested Capital = 23,622 + 5,897 - 35,361 = (29,519) - 35,361 = negative? That can't be right. So that formula must be wrong.\n\nWait, no, the correct formula is usually:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nInvested Capital = (Total Liabilities + Equity) - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nBut Total Liabilities + Equity = Total Assets.\n\nSo the first method is correct.\n\nAlternatively, some sources define Invested Capital as:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Debt + Total Equity - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nBut let's compute that:\n\nTotal Debt = $5,897 million (interest-bearing)\n\nTotal Equity = $23,622 million\n\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities = $35,361 million\n\nSo Invested Capital = 5,897 + 23,622 - 35,361 = 29,519 - 35,361 = -5,842. That's negative, which doesn't make sense. So that formula is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct formula must be Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities.\n\nSo back to that: 69,831 - 35,361 = 34,470.\n\nBut let's check if Goodwill is included. The balance sheet shows \"Other long-term assets\" as $3,936 million, which includes goodwill. The goodwill amount is $994 million (from the segment report: US $953, Canada $26, Other $15). So it's part of the $3,936, so it's already included in Total Assets. Therefore, the calculation includes goodwill.\n\nNow, the problem mentions \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" Maybe this is a hint to adjust the operating cash or something else, but I'm not sure. Let's see what 2% of revenue is: 2% of $254,453 is $5,089.06 million. But how does that relate to Invested Capital?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for Invested Capital including Goodwill, and the \"max potential operating cash\" is a separate instruction, but the main calculation is standard. Maybe the 2% is a distractor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"max potential operating cash\" refers to the maximum cash that could be generated from operations, which is sometimes used in some valuation models, but I don't think it's part of the Invested Capital calculation.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct Invested Capital is $34,470 million.\n\nWait, but let's check the balance sheet again. The current liabilities include \"Other current liabilities 6,210 6,254\". The interest-bearing part is only the current portion of long-term debt ($103), so the rest of current liabilities are non-interest-bearing. So NIBCL is $35,464 - $103 = $35,361.\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831\n\nInvested Capital = 69,831 - 35,361 = 34,470.\n\nBut let's confirm with another source. For example, Invested Capital is often calculated as:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Current Liabilities + Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nWhich is the same as Total Assets - (Current Liabilities - Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities) = Total Assets - NIBCL.\n\nYes, so that's the same as before.\n\nSo the answer should be $34,470 million.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"including Goodwill,\" which is already part of Total Assets, so it's included.\n\nNow, the 2% of revenue: 2% of $254,453 is $5,089.06. Maybe the question is trying to say that we should use 2% of revenue as the operating cash, but I don't see how that affects Invested Capital. Perhaps it's a mistake in the question, and the 2% is irrelevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"max potential operating cash\" refers to the maximum cash that could be generated from operations, which is sometimes used in some models, but I don't think it's part of the Invested Capital calculation.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is $34,470 million.\n\nWait, but let's check the numbers again.\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831\n\nCurrent Liabilities: $35,464\n\nInterest-Bearing Current Liabilities: $103 (current portion of long-term debt)\n\nNIBCL: 35,464 - 103 = 35,361\n\nInvested Capital: 69,831 - 35,361 = 34,470.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: The balance sheet shows Total Liabilities and Equity as $69,831, which matches Total Assets.\n\nTotal Liabilities: $46,209\n\nEquity: $23,622\n\nSo Total Liabilities + Equity = 46,209 + 23,622 = 69,831, which matches.\n\nNow, if we calculate Invested Capital as Equity + Debt - NIBCL, but Debt is interest-bearing debt.\n\nDebt = $5,897 (current portion + long-term debt excluding current portion)\n\nEquity = $23,622\n\nNIBCL = $35,361\n\nSo Equity + Debt - NIBCL = 23,622 + 5,897 - 35,361 = 29,519 - 35,361 = -5,842. That's negative, which doesn't make sense. So that formula is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct formula is Total Assets - NIBCL.\n\nSo the answer should be $34,470 million.\n\nBut let's check if the problem mentions \"including Goodwill,\" and since Goodwill is part of Total Assets, it's already included. So no adjustment needed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $34,470 million.\n</think>\n\nTo determine Invested Capital including Goodwill for 2024, the standard formula is used:  \n**Invested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities (NIBCL)**.  \n\n- **Total Assets (2024)**: $69,831 million (from Consolidated Balance Sheets).  \n- **Current Liabilities**: $35,464 million.  \n- **Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities**: Current portion of long-term debt = $103 million.  \n- **NIBCL** = Current Liabilities - Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities = $35,464 - $103 = $35,361 million.  \n- **Invested Capital** = $69,831 - $35,361 = **$34,470 million**.  \n\nGoodwill ($994 million) is included in \"Other Long-Term Assets\" ($3,936 million) on the balance sheet, so it is already part of Total Assets. The instruction to \"use 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash\" is irrelevant to the Invested Capital calculation and appears to be a distractor.  \n\n<answer>:34470",

      "ground_truth": "$28,245 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The question asks for \"Invested Capital excluding Goodwill for 2024, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Invested Capital typically includes. From my knowledge, Invested Capital is usually calculated as Total Assets minus Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities (like accounts payable, accrued expenses), but sometimes it's defined as Equity + Debt - Non-Operating Assets. However, the problem specifies \"excluding Goodwill,\" so I'll need to adjust for that.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, I see the Consolidated Balance Sheet for September 1, 2024. Let me extract the relevant numbers:\n\n- Total Assets: $69,831 million\n- Goodwill: From Note 10 (Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets), it shows $953 million for the US segment, $26 for Canada, $15 for Other International, totaling $994 million. But the balance sheet lists \"Goodwill\" under \"Other long-term assets\" - wait, actually in the balance sheet, \"Other long-term assets\" is $3,936 million, which includes goodwill. But the note says goodwill is $994 million. So I'll use $994 million as the goodwill amount.\n\nSo, Invested Capital excluding Goodwill would be Total Assets minus Goodwill minus Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities. Wait, but the standard formula for Invested Capital is often:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash\n\nBut the problem mentions \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash,\" which might mean we need to adjust for cash beyond what's needed for operations.\n\nFirst, let's get the components:\n\nTotal Assets (2024): $69,831 million\nGoodwill: $994 million (from the goodwill note)\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities: This would include Accounts Payable, Accrued Salaries, Accrued Member Rewards, Deferred Membership Fees, Other Current Liabilities. But typically, for Invested Capital, we subtract non-interest-bearing current liabilities (like AP, accruals) because they're part of operating capital.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, Current Liabilities are $35,464 million. But not all are non-interest-bearing. The current portion of long-term debt ($103 million) is interest-bearing, so we should exclude that. So Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current Portion of Long-Term Debt = $35,464 - $103 = $35,361 million.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" So we need to adjust for cash. The max operating cash is 2% of revenue. Revenue for 2024 is $254,453 million (Total Revenue from Income Statement). So 2% of that is 0.02 * 254,453 = $5,089.06 million.\n\nNow, Cash and Cash Equivalents as per balance sheet: $9,906 million. But we need to subtract the max potential operating cash to get the \"excess\" cash that's not part of invested capital. Wait, no: the formula for Invested Capital often subtracts excess cash. So Invested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash.\n\nBut the problem says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash,\" meaning that the company should hold at most 2% of revenue as cash for operations, and any cash above that is considered excess and should be subtracted from Invested Capital.\n\nSo, Excess Cash = Cash and Cash Equivalents - (2% of Revenue)\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents: $9,906 million\n2% of Revenue: 0.02 * 254,453 = $5,089.06 million\nExcess Cash = 9,906 - 5,089.06 = $4,816.94 million\n\nNow, Invested Capital excluding Goodwill = Total Assets - Goodwill - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash\n\nWait, but let's confirm the standard formula. Invested Capital is typically:\n\nInvested Capital = (Total Assets - Non-Operating Assets) - (Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities)\n\nBut sometimes it's:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash\n\nAnd we're excluding Goodwill, so we subtract Goodwill from Total Assets first.\n\nSo:\n\nTotal Assets = $69,831\nGoodwill = $994\nSo Assets excluding Goodwill = 69,831 - 994 = $68,837\n\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities: As above, Current Liabilities - Current Portion of Long-Term Debt = 35,464 - 103 = $35,361\n\nExcess Cash = $4,816.94\n\nSo Invested Capital = Assets excluding Goodwill - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash\n= 68,837 - 35,361 - 4,816.94\n= 68,837 - 35,361 = 33,476; 33,476 - 4,816.94 = $28,659.06 million\n\nBut let me double-check. Another way to calculate Invested Capital is:\n\nInvested Capital = Equity + Debt - Non-Operating Assets\n\nBut the problem specifies \"excluding Goodwill,\" so we need to adjust.\n\nDebt: Long-term debt excluding current portion is $5,794 million, and current portion is $103 million, so total debt = 5,794 + 103 = $5,897 million.\n\nEquity: Total Equity is $23,622 million.\n\nNon-Operating Assets: Goodwill is part of operating assets, but the problem says exclude Goodwill. Wait, but Goodwill is typically part of operating assets. So if we exclude Goodwill, we need to subtract it from the asset side.\n\nBut let's stick to the first method since it's more straightforward.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Invested Capital excluding Goodwill,\" so we should not include Goodwill in the calculation. So:\n\nInvested Capital = (Total Assets - Goodwill) - (Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities) - (Excess Cash)\n\nTotal Assets - Goodwill = 69,831 - 994 = 68,837\n\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities: As calculated, $35,361 million (current liabilities minus current portion of debt)\n\nExcess Cash: $4,816.94 million\n\nSo 68,837 - 35,361 = 33,476; 33,476 - 4,816.94 = 28,659.06\n\nRounding to the nearest million, it's $28,659 million.\n\nBut let me verify the Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities. The current liabilities include:\n\n- Accounts payable: $19,421\n- Accrued salaries: $4,794\n- Accrued member rewards: $2,435\n- Deferred membership fees: $2,501\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103 (interest-bearing)\n- Other current liabilities: $6,210\n\nSo non-interest-bearing current liabilities = 19,421 + 4,794 + 2,435 + 2,501 + 6,210 = let's calculate:\n\n19,421 + 4,794 = 24,215\n24,215 + 2,435 = 26,650\n26,650 + 2,501 = 29,151\n29,151 + 6,210 = 35,361 million. Yes, matches earlier calculation.\n\nRevenue: $254,453 million (total revenue from income statement)\n\n2% of revenue: 0.02 * 254,453 = 5,089.06 million\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents: $9,906 million\n\nExcess Cash: 9,906 - 5,089.06 = 4,816.94 million\n\nNow, Invested Capital excluding Goodwill:\n\n= (Total Assets - Goodwill) - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash\n= (69,831 - 994) - 35,361 - 4,816.94\n= 68,837 - 35,361 - 4,816.94\n= 33,476 - 4,816.94\n= 28,659.06\n\nSo approximately $28,659 million.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Sometimes Invested Capital is calculated as:\n\nInvested Capital = (Total Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Current Portion of Debt)\n\nBut the problem specifies using 2% of revenue as max operating cash, so we need to adjust cash to 2% of revenue.\n\nSo, the formula should be:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Goodwill - (Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities) - (Cash - 2% of Revenue)\n\nWhich is the same as what I did.\n\nAnother point: The problem says \"max potential operating cash,\" so we're assuming that the company should hold no more than 2% of revenue as cash, so any cash above that is excess and should be subtracted.\n\nYes, so the calculation seems correct.\n\nNow, let's confirm the numbers once more:\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831\nGoodwill: $994 (from the goodwill note: $953 + $26 + $15 = $994)\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities: $35,361 (as calculated)\nCash: $9,906\n2% of Revenue: $5,089.06\nExcess Cash: $4,816.94\n\nSo:\n\n69,831 - 994 = 68,837\n68,837 - 35,361 = 33,476\n33,476 - 4,816.94 = 28,659.06\n\nRounded to the nearest million, it's $28,659 million.\n\nBut the problem says \"in the correct financial format,\" so probably as a number without commas, but in millions. Wait, the context shows numbers like $249,625, so likely with commas.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format like $28,659 million.\n\nWait, but let's check if the problem expects just the number without the dollar sign. The instructions say \"concise, in the correct financial format,\" so probably $28,659 million.\n\nBut looking at the context, they use \"$249,625\" for revenue, so I'll use that format.\n\nWait, but the answer should be a number, perhaps without the dollar sign. The problem says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\"\n\nIn financial contexts, it's common to write it as 28,659 (implying millions), but to be precise, since all numbers are in millions, we can just state the number.\n\nWait, the balance sheet says \"amounts in millions,\" so the answer should be in millions, so $28,659 million, but typically written as 28,659 (since it's in millions).\n\nBut to be safe, I'll check the problem's examples. The revenue is listed as \"$249,625\" (which is in millions), so the answer should be similar.\n\nSo the final answer is 28,659.\n\nBut let me confirm once more.\n\nAlternative approach: Invested Capital = Equity + Debt - Non-Operating Assets\n\nEquity: $23,622 million\nDebt: Long-term debt excluding current portion ($5,794) + current portion ($103) = $5,897 million\nNon-Operating Assets: Goodwill is $994 million (but the problem says exclude Goodwill, so we don't subtract it here; wait, no—if we're excluding Goodwill, then Non-Operating Assets might be different, but Goodwill is usually considered part of operating assets. This approach might not be correct.\n\nThe standard formula for Invested Capital is:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash\n\nAnd since we're excluding Goodwill, we subtract Goodwill from Total Assets first.\n\nSo I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nAnother check: The problem says \"excluding Goodwill,\" so we must remove Goodwill from the asset base.\n\nYes, so Total Assets - Goodwill = 69,831 - 994 = 68,837.\n\nThen subtract non-interest-bearing current liabilities (35,361) and excess cash (4,817).\n\n68,837 - 35,361 = 33,476\n\n33,476 - 4,817 = 28,659\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final answer should be 28,659.\n</think>\n\nTo determine Invested Capital excluding Goodwill for 2024, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash:\n\n1. **Total Assets (2024)**: $69,831 million  \n2. **Goodwill**: $994 million (from Note 10: $953 + $26 + $15)  \n3. **Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities**:  \n   - Total Current Liabilities: $35,464 million  \n   - Minus Current Portion of Long-Term Debt ($103 million): $35,464 - $103 = $35,361 million  \n4. **Max Potential Operating Cash (2% of Revenue)**:  \n   - Total Revenue (2024): $254,453 million  \n   - 2% × $254,453 = $5,089.06 million  \n5. **Excess Cash**:  \n   - Cash and Cash Equivalents: $9,906 million  \n   - Excess = $9,906 - $5,089.06 = $4,816.94 million  \n\n**Invested Capital (excluding Goodwill)**:  \n= (Total Assets - Goodwill) - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash  \n= ($69,831 - $994) - $35,361 - $4,816.94  \n= $68,837 - $35,361 - $4,816.94  \n= $28,659.06 million  \n\nRounded to the nearest million: **$28,659 million**.\n\n<answer>:28,659",

      "question": "Determine Invested Capital including Goodwill for 2023, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.",
      "ground_truth": "$26,915 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the Invested Capital including Goodwill for 2023, with a specific instruction to use 2% of revenue as the max potential operating cash.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Invested Capital typically includes. From my knowledge, Invested Capital is usually calculated as Total Assets minus Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities (like accounts payable, accrued expenses, etc.). But the problem specifies \"including Goodwill,\" so I should make sure to include that in the calculation.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements for Costco, I need to find the relevant figures for 2023. The balance sheet for September 3, 2023 (which is the end of the 2023 fiscal year) shows:\n\n- Total Assets: $68,994 million\n- Total Liabilities: $43,936 million\n- Equity: $25,058 million\n\nBut Invested Capital is typically Total Assets minus Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities. However, the problem mentions \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash,\" which might be a hint to adjust for operating cash. Wait, the instruction says \"including Goodwill,\" so I need to confirm if Goodwill is already included in the assets.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, Goodwill is part of \"Other Assets.\" In the balance sheet, under \"OTHER ASSETS,\" there's \"Property and equipment, net,\" \"Operating lease right-of-use assets,\" and \"Other long-term assets.\" The Goodwill is mentioned in Note 10 (Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets), but the balance sheet doesn't explicitly list Goodwill. However, the note states that goodwill is included in other long-term assets. The balance sheet shows \"Other long-term assets\" as $3,718 million for 2023. But the note says goodwill is $994 million (from the table: United States $953, Canada $26, Other International $15, total $994). So Goodwill is part of the $3,718 million in other long-term assets.\n\nBut for Invested Capital, we usually include all assets used in operations, so Goodwill should be included. However, the standard formula for Invested Capital is:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities would include accounts payable, accrued salaries, accrued member rewards, deferred membership fees, and other current liabilities. But the problem mentions \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash,\" which might mean we need to adjust for operating cash.\n\nWait, the instruction says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" So perhaps we need to calculate the operating cash as 2% of revenue, and then adjust the Invested Capital accordingly. But how does that fit in?\n\nLet me think. Sometimes, in some models, Invested Capital is calculated as:\n\nInvested Capital = (Total Assets - Cash and Cash Equivalents) - (Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Operating Cash)\n\nBut the problem specifies \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash,\" so maybe we should set the operating cash to 2% of revenue, and then adjust the Invested Capital by subtracting that from the cash.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Determine Invested Capital including Goodwill for 2023, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the standard Invested Capital calculation is adjusted by considering that the company can have up to 2% of revenue as operating cash, so we subtract that from the cash to get the \"operating cash\" that's part of invested capital.\n\nBut let's clarify:\n\nTypically, Invested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nBut sometimes, it's adjusted to exclude excess cash. The problem says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash,\" meaning that any cash beyond 2% of revenue is considered excess and should be subtracted from Invested Capital.\n\nSo, first, find the cash and cash equivalents for 2023: $13,700 million (from the balance sheet, September 3, 2023).\n\nRevenue for 2023: $242,290 million (from the income statement, 53 Weeks Ended September 3, 2023).\n\n2% of revenue = 0.02 * 242,290 = $4,845.8 million.\n\nSo, the max potential operating cash is $4,845.8 million. The actual cash is $13,700 million, which is higher than the max. So, the excess cash is $13,700 - $4,845.8 = $8,854.2 million.\n\nTherefore, the Invested Capital would be:\n\nTotal Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - (Cash - Max Operating Cash)\n\nBut let's confirm the formula.\n\nStandard Invested Capital (without adjustment) is:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nBut to exclude excess cash, it's:\n\nInvested Capital = (Total Assets - Cash) - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities + (Cash - Max Operating Cash)\n\nWait, no. The correct way is:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - (Cash - Max Operating Cash)\n\nBecause if Cash > Max Operating Cash, then the excess cash (Cash - Max Operating Cash) is not part of the invested capital.\n\nSo, Invested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - (Cash - Max Operating Cash)\n\nBut let's verify with the numbers.\n\nFirst, Total Assets for 2023: $68,994 million.\n\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities: These are current liabilities that don't bear interest, like accounts payable, accrued expenses, etc. From the balance sheet, current liabilities include:\n\n- Accounts payable: $17,483\n- Accrued salaries and benefits: $4,278\n- Accrued member rewards: $2,150\n- Deferred membership fees: $2,337\n- Other current liabilities: $6,254\n\nTotal Current Liabilities: $33,583 million.\n\nBut not all current liabilities are non-interest-bearing. The current portion of long-term debt is $1,081, which is interest-bearing. So, Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current Portion of Long-Term Debt.\n\nSo, Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities = $33,583 - $1,081 = $32,502 million.\n\nMax Operating Cash = 2% of Revenue = 0.02 * $242,290 = $4,845.8 million.\n\nActual Cash and Cash Equivalents: $13,700 million.\n\nExcess Cash = $13,700 - $4,845.8 = $8,854.2 million.\n\nNow, Invested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash\n\n= $68,994 - $32,502 - $8,854.2\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$68,994 - $32,502 = $36,492\n\n$36,492 - $8,854.2 = $27,637.8 million.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"including Goodwill.\" In the standard calculation, Goodwill is already included in Total Assets, so we don't need to adjust for it separately. The Goodwill is part of the assets, so it's already included.\n\nBut let's confirm if the calculation above is correct. Another way to think about Invested Capital is:\n\nInvested Capital = (Total Assets - Cash) - (Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Operating Cash)\n\nBut I think the first method is correct.\n\nAlternatively, some sources define Invested Capital as:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - (Cash - Operating Cash)\n\nWhere Operating Cash is the minimum cash needed, which here is 2% of revenue.\n\nSo, Operating Cash = 2% of revenue = $4,845.8 million.\n\nTherefore, Invested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - (Cash - Operating Cash)\n\n= $68,994 - $32,502 - ($13,700 - $4,845.8)\n\n= $68,994 - $32,502 - $8,854.2\n\n= $68,994 - $41,356.2\n\n= $27,637.8 million.\n\nSo, approximately $27,638 million.\n\nBut let's check if the problem expects rounding. The revenue is in millions, so probably round to the nearest million.\n\n$27,637.8 million rounds to $27,638 million.\n\nBut let's verify the numbers again.\n\nTotal Assets: $68,994\n\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities: $33,583 (total current liabilities) - $1,081 (current portion of long-term debt) = $32,502\n\nCash: $13,700\n\nMax Operating Cash: 2% of $242,290 = $4,845.8\n\nExcess Cash: $13,700 - $4,845.8 = $8,854.2\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash\n\n= $68,994 - $32,502 - $8,854.2 = $27,637.8\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, another way to calculate Invested Capital is:\n\nInvested Capital = (Total Assets - Cash) - (Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Operating Cash)\n\nBut let's see:\n\nTotal Assets - Cash = $68,994 - $13,700 = $55,294\n\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Operating Cash = $32,502 - $4,845.8 = $27,656.2\n\nThen Invested Capital = $55,294 - $27,656.2 = $27,637.8\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, the answer should be $27,638 million.\n\nBut let's check if the problem mentions \"including Goodwill,\" and since Goodwill is part of Total Assets, it's already included, so no need to adjust further.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"for 2023,\" so we're using the 2023 balance sheet (September 3, 2023).\n\nAnother point: The problem says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" So we're using 2% of revenue as the max, which we did.\n\nSo, the final answer should be $27,638 million.\n\nBut let's check if the numbers are correct.\n\nRevenue for 2023: $242,290 million (from the income statement, \"53 Weeks Ended September 3, 2023\" revenue is $242,290 million).\n\n2% of that is $4,845.8 million.\n\nCash: $13,700 million.\n\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities: Total Current Liabilities $33,583 minus current portion of long-term debt $1,081 = $32,502.\n\nTotal Assets: $68,994.\n\nSo, $68,994 - $32,502 = $36,492.\n\n$36,492 - ($13,700 - $4,845.8) = $36,492 - $8,854.2 = $27,637.8.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, rounding to the nearest million, it's $27,638 million.\n\nBut in financial contexts, sometimes they keep it as is, but the problem says \"concise, in the correct financial format,\" so probably $27,638 million.\n\nWait, but let's check if the problem expects the answer without the \"million\" part, but since all numbers are in millions, it's standard to present it as a number with the unit implied.\n\nBut the instruction says \"in the correct financial format,\" so likely as a number like 27638, but since the context uses millions, it's common to write it as $27,638 million.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be concise. Looking at the problem statement, the numbers are presented as \"$249,625\" etc., so the answer should be \"$27,638\" (implying millions).\n\nWait, the problem says \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\"\n\nIn the context, all figures are in millions, so the answer should be a number like 27638, but with commas as per standard financial format.\n\nSo, $27,638 million, but since it's in millions, it's often written as $27,638 (with the understanding that it's in millions).\n\nBut to be precise, the answer should be $27,638.\n\nWait, let's see the original context: \"amounts in millions, except per share data.\" So all numbers are in millions. So when they say \"27,638,\" it's 27,638 million dollars.\n\nBut in the answer, we should present it as a number with commas, like $27,638.\n\nBut the problem says \"in the correct financial format,\" so likely $27,638.\n\nBut let's confirm the calculation once more.\n\nTotal Assets: 68,994\n\nNon-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities: 33,583 - 1,081 = 32,502\n\nCash: 13,700\n\nMax Operating Cash: 0.02 * 242,290 = 4,845.8\n\nExcess Cash: 13,700 - 4,845.8 = 8,854.2\n\nInvested Capital = 68,994 - 32,502 - 8,854.2 = 27,637.8 ≈ 27,638\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final answer is $27,638.\n</think>\n\nTo determine Invested Capital including Goodwill for 2023, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash:\n\n1. **Total Assets (2023)**: $68,994 million (from balance sheet).\n2. **Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities**:\n   - Total Current Liabilities: $33,583 million\n   - Minus Current Portion of Long-Term Debt ($1,081 million): $33,583 - $1,081 = $32,502 million.\n3. **Max Potential Operating Cash**:\n   - 2% of Revenue (2023): 0.02 × $242,290 = $4,845.8 million.\n4. **Excess Cash**:\n   - Cash and Cash Equivalents (2023): $13,700 million\n   - Excess = $13,700 - $4,845.8 = $8,854.2 million.\n5. **Invested Capital**:\n   - Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities - Excess Cash\n   - $68,994 - $32,502 - $8,854.2 = $27,637.8 million ≈ **$27,638 million**.\n\nGoodwill is included in Total Assets (as part of \"Other Long-Term Assets\" per Note 10), so no separate adjustment is needed.\n\n<answer>:27638",

      "question": "Determine the Average Invested Capital (includes Goodwill) over 2023 and 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "$28,077 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is to determine the Average Invested Capital (including Goodwill) over 2023 and 2024. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Invested Capital typically includes. From my knowledge, Invested Capital is usually calculated as Total Assets minus Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities. But the problem specifies \"includes Goodwill,\" so I should check if Goodwill is part of the assets.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet provided, Goodwill is mentioned in Note 10 (Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets). The balance sheet shows \"Other long-term assets\" which includes Goodwill. The balance sheet for 2024 and 2023 lists \"Other long-term assets\" as $3,936 million and $3,718 million, respectively. But the note says Goodwill is $953 million (from the table under Goodwill by segment: United States $953, Canada $26, Other International $15, total $994). Wait, the note says \"Goodwill is included in other long-term assets.\" So the $3,936 million for 2024 includes Goodwill.\n\nBut to calculate Invested Capital, I need to confirm the standard formula. Invested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities (NIBCL). NIBCL usually includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, etc., but not interest-bearing debt.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Average Invested Capital (includes Goodwill)\". So I need to make sure that Goodwill is part of the calculation. Since Goodwill is part of Total Assets, and the formula for Invested Capital typically uses Total Assets minus NIBCL, then including Goodwill is already covered because Goodwill is part of Total Assets.\n\nBut let's verify the exact formula. Sometimes Invested Capital is defined as Equity + Debt - Cash. But the problem specifies \"includes Goodwill,\" which is part of assets, so probably the standard formula.\n\nWait, the problem might be using a specific definition. Let's check the context. The user provided a lot of financial statements. Let's look for the exact definition in the context.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, Total Assets for 2024 is $69,831 million, and for 2023 is $68,994 million. But Invested Capital isn't directly given. So I need to compute it.\n\nStandard formula for Invested Capital (IC) is:\n\nIC = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities (NIBCL)\n\nNIBCL typically includes accounts payable, accrued liabilities, etc., but excludes interest-bearing debt.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, Current Liabilities are $35,464 million (2024) and $33,583 million (2023). But Current Liabilities include both interest-bearing (like current portion of long-term debt) and non-interest-bearing.\n\nThe Current Liabilities include:\n\n- Accounts payable: $19,421 (2024)\n- Accrued salaries and benefits: $4,794\n- Accrued member rewards: $2,435\n- Deferred membership fees: $2,501\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103 (this is interest-bearing)\n- Other current liabilities: $6,210\n\nSo the interest-bearing part here is the current portion of long-term debt ($103 million in 2024). So NIBCL would be Total Current Liabilities minus Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities.\n\nSo NIBCL = Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt.\n\nFor 2024: $35,464 - $103 = $35,361 million\n\nFor 2023: $33,583 - $1,081 = $32,502 million\n\nThen Invested Capital = Total Assets - NIBCL\n\nFor 2024: $69,831 - $35,361 = $34,470 million\n\nFor 2023: $68,994 - $32,502 = $36,492 million\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Average Invested Capital over 2023 and 2024\". So average of 2023 and 2024 Invested Capital.\n\nAverage = (IC_2023 + IC_2024) / 2\n\nSo (36,492 + 34,470) / 2 = (70,962) / 2 = 35,481 million.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is the current portion of long-term debt considered interest-bearing? Yes, because it's part of debt, so it's interest-bearing. So subtracting it from current liabilities to get NIBCL is correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes Invested Capital is calculated as Total Debt + Equity - Cash. Let's see if that's another way.\n\nTotal Debt: Long-term debt excluding current portion + current portion of long-term debt.\n\nFor 2024: $5,794 (long-term) + $103 (current) = $5,897 million\n\nEquity: Total Equity is $23,622 million (2024)\n\nCash: $9,906 million\n\nSo Invested Capital = Debt + Equity - Cash = 5,897 + 23,622 - 9,906 = 29,613 million. But this is different from the previous calculation. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Average Invested Capital (includes Goodwill)\". The first method (Total Assets - NIBCL) is standard. The second method (Debt + Equity - Cash) is also a common definition, but let's see which one is intended here.\n\nIn the context of the problem, since they mention \"includes Goodwill\", and Goodwill is part of Total Assets, the first method is more likely. Also, the second method might not include Goodwill explicitly, but since Goodwill is part of Total Assets, it's already included.\n\nWait, but let's check the standard definition. Invested Capital is typically defined as the sum of debt and equity minus non-operating assets (like excess cash). So Debt + Equity - Cash.\n\nBut let's verify with the numbers.\n\nTotal Assets = $69,831 (2024)\n\nTotal Liabilities + Equity = $69,831 (since it's a balance sheet)\n\nLiabilities = $46,209 (total liabilities)\n\nEquity = $23,622\n\nSo Total Liabilities + Equity = $69,831.\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities (NIBCL)\n\nWhich is the same as (Total Liabilities + Equity) - NIBCL - Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities? Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, Invested Capital = (Total Assets - Cash) - (Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities)\n\nBut I think the standard formula is:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nBecause NIBCL are obligations that don't require interest, so they're part of the operating capital.\n\nLet me confirm with a source. For example, in finance, Invested Capital is often calculated as:\n\nInvested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities\n\nYes, that's a common formula. So for example, if a company has $100 in assets, $50 in current liabilities (all non-interest-bearing), then Invested Capital is $50.\n\nSo applying that here.\n\nFor 2024:\n\nTotal Assets = $69,831\n\nNIBCL = Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = $35,464 - $103 = $35,361\n\nInvested Capital = 69,831 - 35,361 = $34,470\n\nFor 2023:\n\nTotal Assets = $68,994\n\nNIBCL = $33,583 - $1,081 = $32,502\n\nInvested Capital = 68,994 - 32,502 = $36,492\n\nAverage = (34,470 + 36,492) / 2 = 70,962 / 2 = $35,481 million\n\nBut let's check if the problem includes Goodwill. Since Goodwill is part of Total Assets, and we're subtracting NIBCL, which is correct. The problem says \"includes Goodwill\", which is already part of the calculation because Goodwill is in Total Assets.\n\nWait, but in the balance sheet, \"Other long-term assets\" includes Goodwill. So when we take Total Assets, it's already including Goodwill. So the calculation is correct.\n\nAnother way to check: the problem might be using a different definition. For example, sometimes Invested Capital is defined as Equity + Debt - Cash. Let's see what that gives.\n\nFor 2024:\n\nDebt = Long-term debt (excluding current portion) + Current portion of long-term debt = $5,794 + $103 = $5,897\n\nEquity = $23,622\n\nCash = $9,906\n\nInvested Capital = 5,897 + 23,622 - 9,906 = 29,613\n\nFor 2023:\n\nDebt = $5,377 + $1,081 = $6,458\n\nEquity = $25,058\n\nCash = $13,700\n\nInvested Capital = 6,458 + 25,058 - 13,700 = 17,816\n\nAverage = (29,613 + 17,816)/2 = 23,714.5, which is different. But this seems too low, and the problem mentions \"includes Goodwill\", which this method doesn't explicitly handle, but Goodwill is part of Equity? No, Goodwill is part of assets, not equity.\n\nWait, no. Goodwill is part of assets, so in the first method, it's included in Total Assets. In the second method, it's not directly subtracted, but since it's part of assets, it's included in the calculation.\n\nBut the two methods give different results. Which one is correct for the problem?\n\nThe problem says \"Average Invested Capital (includes Goodwill)\". The standard definition that includes Goodwill is the first method, because Goodwill is part of Total Assets. The second method (Debt + Equity - Cash) is also a valid definition, but let's see which one is more likely expected here.\n\nLooking at the context, the problem is from a financial reasoning agent, so they probably expect the standard formula.\n\nAnother check: in the balance sheet, the \"Total Assets\" includes Goodwill, so when we do Total Assets - NIBCL, Goodwill is included. So the first method is correct.\n\nLet me check the numbers again.\n\n2024:\n\nTotal Assets: $69,831\n\nCurrent Liabilities: $35,464\n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt: $103 (interest-bearing)\n\nSo NIBCL = 35,464 - 103 = 35,361\n\nInvested Capital = 69,831 - 35,361 = 34,470\n\n2023:\n\nTotal Assets: $68,994\n\nCurrent Liabilities: $33,583\n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt: $1,081\n\nNIBCL = 33,583 - 1,081 = 32,502\n\nInvested Capital = 68,994 - 32,502 = 36,492\n\nAverage = (34,470 + 36,492)/2 = 35,481\n\nSo the answer should be $35,481 million.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other consideration. For example, sometimes \"Invested Capital\" is defined as Total Assets - Current Liabilities (excluding interest-bearing), but that's the same as what I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to exclude certain items. But the problem says \"includes Goodwill\", which is already included in Total Assets.\n\nAnother point: the problem says \"Average Invested Capital over 2023 and 2024\". So we take the beginning and end of each year. Wait, but the balance sheet is as of September 1, 2024 (end of 2024) and September 3, 2023 (end of 2023). So the 2023 balance sheet is as of the end of 2023, and 2024 as of end of 2024. So the Invested Capital for 2023 is the value at the end of 2023, and for 2024 at the end of 2024. So the average is (IC_2023 + IC_2024)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems right.\n\nNow, let's check if the numbers add up.\n\nFor 2024:\n\nTotal Assets: 69,831\n\nNIBCL: 35,361\n\n69,831 - 35,361 = 34,470. Correct.\n\n2023:\n\n68,994 - 32,502 = 36,492. Correct.\n\nAverage: (34,470 + 36,492)/2 = 35,481.\n\nSo the answer should be $35,481 million.\n\nBut let's check if the problem expects it in millions, which it does, as all figures are in millions.\n\nSo the final answer is 35,481 million, which would be written as $35,481 million, but in the required format, probably just the number.\n\nWait, the problem says \"in the correct financial format\". Typically, for such answers, it's written as a number with commas, but since it's a final answer, maybe just the number.\n\nBut looking at the instructions: \"The final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\"\n\nSo probably $35,481 million, but since the context uses \"amounts in millions\", the answer should be 35,481.\n\nWait, the problem says \"amounts in millions\", so the answer should be 35,481 (since it's in millions of dollars).\n\nYes, for example, if the number is $35,481 million, then the answer is 35,481.\n\nSo the final answer is 35,481.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the Average Invested Capital (including Goodwill) over 2023 and 2024, the standard formula is used:  \n**Invested Capital = Total Assets - Non-Interest-Bearing Current Liabilities (NIBCL)**.  \nNIBCL is calculated as **Current Liabilities - Current Portion of Long-Term Debt** (since the current portion of debt is interest-bearing).  \n\n**2024 Calculation**:  \n- Total Assets = $69,831 million  \n- Current Liabilities = $35,464 million  \n- Current Portion of Long-Term Debt = $103 million  \n- NIBCL = $35,464 - $103 = $35,361 million  \n- Invested Capital = $69,831 - $35,361 = **$34,470 million**  \n\n**2023 Calculation**:  \n- Total Assets = $68,994 million  \n- Current Liabilities = $33,583 million  \n- Current Portion of Long-Term Debt = $1,081 million  \n- NIBCL = $33,583 - $1,081 = $32,502 million  \n- Invested Capital = $68,994 - $32,502 = **$36,492 million**  \n\n**Average Invested Capital**:  \n($34,470 + $36,492) / 2 = **$35,481 million**  \n\nGoodwill is included in Total Assets (as noted in the balance sheet under \"Other Long-Term Assets\"), so the calculation inherently includes it.  \n\n<answer>:35481",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"What is the operating portion of long-term assets in 2024?\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"operating portion of long-term assets\" means. In financial statements, long-term assets typically include items like property, plant, equipment, and other long-term investments. The \"operating portion\" would refer to assets used in the company's core operations, as opposed to non-operating assets like investments.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements for Costco, I should check the balance sheet under \"ASSETS\" to find long-term assets. The balance sheet shows:\n\n- Property and equipment, net: $29,032 million (2024)\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,617 million (2024)\n- Other long-term assets: $3,936 million (2024)\n\nThe question is about the \"operating portion.\" Operating lease right-of-use assets are directly related to operating leases, so they should be part of the operating assets. Property and equipment is also clearly operating. Other long-term assets might include non-operating items, but the context doesn't specify.\n\nWait, the term \"operating portion\" might refer specifically to assets used in operations. In the balance sheet, \"Property and equipment, net\" and \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" are both operating assets. \"Other long-term assets\" could include things like investments or intangibles, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, the total long-term assets would be the sum of Property and equipment, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. But the question asks for the \"operating portion,\" so I need to determine which of these are operating.\n\nTypically, property and equipment (net) and operating lease right-of-use assets are considered operating. Other long-term assets might include non-operating items like investments, but the note says \"Other long-term assets\" and the context doesn't specify. However, in the balance sheet, \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" is explicitly labeled as operating, so that's part of the operating portion.\n\nBut the question is asking for the \"operating portion of long-term assets.\" So, the operating portion would be Property and equipment, net plus Operating lease right-of-use assets. Let me check the numbers:\n\n- Property and equipment, net: $29,032 million\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,617 million\n\nAdding those together: 29,032 + 2,617 = $31,649 million.\n\nWait, but the \"Other long-term assets\" is $3,936 million. If \"other long-term assets\" includes non-operating items, then the operating portion would exclude that. But the problem doesn't specify. However, in the context of the question, \"operating portion\" likely refers to assets directly used in operations, which would be property and equipment plus operating leases.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, the \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" is listed under \"OTHER ASSETS\" but labeled as operating. So, it's part of the operating assets. Property and equipment is also operating. So the sum of these two should be the operating portion.\n\nLet me confirm with the balance sheet structure:\n\n- CURRENT ASSETS\n- OTHER ASSETS\n  - Property and equipment, net\n  - Operating lease right-of-use assets\n  - Other long-term assets\n\nSo, Property and equipment and Operating lease right-of-use assets are both under \"OTHER ASSETS\" but are operating. The \"Other long-term assets\" might include non-operating items, so the operating portion would be Property and equipment + Operating lease right-of-use assets.\n\nTherefore, 29,032 + 2,617 = 31,649 million.\n\nWait, but the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets.\" Long-term assets would include all of these, but the operating portion is the part used in operations. So yes, Property and equipment and Operating lease right-of-use assets are operating, while Other long-term assets might not be.\n\nLooking at the note 5 on leases, it says \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" are part of operating leases, so they are operating. Property and equipment is clearly operating. So the sum should be the answer.\n\nLet me check the numbers again from the balance sheet:\n\nSeptember 1, 2024:\n- Property and equipment, net: $29,032\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,617\n- Other long-term assets: $3,936\n\nSo operating portion = 29,032 + 2,617 = 31,649.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets.\" Is there a chance that \"operating portion\" refers to something else? For example, in some contexts, \"operating assets\" might exclude certain items, but I think in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nAnother way to check: in the consolidated balance sheet, the \"OTHER ASSETS\" section lists Property and equipment, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. So the operating portion would be the first two, as they are directly related to operations.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $29,032 + $2,617 = $31,649 million.\n\nWait, but let me check if \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" is considered part of the operating portion. Yes, because they are for operating leases, not finance leases. The note 5 shows that operating lease assets are separate from finance lease assets (which are $1,433 million, but that's under finance leases, not operating).\n\nSo, the operating portion is Property and equipment (net) plus Operating lease right-of-use assets.\n\nThus, 29,032 + 2,617 = 31,649.\n\nThe answer should be $31,649 million, but the question might expect it in the format as presented in the financials, which is in millions. So the number is 31,649.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact numbers again from the balance sheet:\n\n\"Property and equipment, net 29,032 26,684\"\n\n\"Operating lease right-of-use assets 2,617 2,713\"\n\nSo yes, 29,032 + 2,617 = 31,649.\n\nTherefore, the operating portion of long-term assets in 2024 is $31,649 million.\n</think>\n\nThe operating portion of long-term assets refers to assets directly used in operations, which include Property and equipment, net and Operating lease right-of-use assets. From the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 1, 2024:\n- Property and equipment, net: $29,032 million\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,617 million\n\nSumming these gives the operating portion: $29,032 + $2,617 = $31,649 million.\n\n<answer>:31649",

      "ground_truth": "$34,029 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"What is the operating portion of long-term assets in 2023?\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"operating portion of long-term assets\" means. In financial statements, long-term assets typically include items like property, plant, equipment, and other long-term investments. The \"operating portion\" likely refers to assets used in the company's core operations, as opposed to non-operating assets like investments.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, specifically the Consolidated Balance Sheets for 2023 (September 3, 2023), I see the following assets:\n\n- Property and equipment, net: $26,684 million\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,713 million\n- Other long-term assets: $3,718 million\n\nThe question is about the \"operating portion\" of long-term assets. In the context of Costco, the operating lease right-of-use assets are directly related to their operating leases for warehouses and other facilities. Property and equipment (net) is also an operating asset. Other long-term assets might include things like goodwill or investments, which could be non-operating.\n\nBut the term \"operating portion\" might specifically refer to assets used in day-to-day operations. The balance sheet lists \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" separately, which are part of operating leases. The property and equipment is also operating. The other long-term assets might include non-operating items.\n\nWait, the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets.\" So, perhaps they want the sum of the operating-related long-term assets. In the balance sheet, the assets are categorized as:\n\n- Property and equipment, net (operating)\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets (operating)\n- Other long-term assets (could be mixed)\n\nBut the problem is, \"other long-term assets\" might include both operating and non-operating. However, in the context of the question, \"operating portion\" likely refers to the assets directly used in operations, which would be property and equipment plus operating lease right-of-use assets.\n\nLooking at the 2023 balance sheet (September 3, 2023):\n\n- Property and equipment, net: $26,684 million\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,713 million\n- Other long-term assets: $3,718 million\n\nIf \"operating portion\" means the assets used in operations, then property and equipment and operating lease assets are operating. The other long-term assets might include things like goodwill, which is part of the business but not a physical asset used in operations. However, goodwill is often considered part of operating assets in some contexts.\n\nWait, but the question specifies \"operating portion,\" which might exclude non-operating assets. Let me check the notes. In Note 5—Leases, it says \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" are listed separately. The property and equipment is also operating. The other long-term assets include goodwill (from Note 10: Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets), which is part of the business but not a physical asset. However, goodwill is typically considered part of operating assets.\n\nBut the question is about \"operating portion,\" so maybe they want the sum of property and equipment and operating lease assets. Let's see the numbers.\n\nIn the balance sheet, the total long-term assets would be Property and equipment, net + Operating lease right-of-use assets + Other long-term assets. But the \"operating portion\" might be the first two, as operating lease assets are explicitly for operations.\n\nWait, the balance sheet lists:\n\nOTHER ASSETS\nProperty and equipment, net 29,032 26,684\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 2,617 2,713\nOther long-term assets 3,936 3,718\n\nSo for 2023 (September 3, 2023), the numbers are:\n\n- Property and equipment, net: $26,684 million\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,713 million\n- Other long-term assets: $3,718 million\n\nNow, \"operating portion\" likely refers to the assets used in operations. Property and equipment is clearly operating. Operating lease right-of-use assets are also operating (since they're for leases of operating facilities). Other long-term assets might include non-operating items like investments, but in Costco's case, the other long-term assets include goodwill (from Note 10), which is part of the business but not a physical asset. However, goodwill is typically considered part of operating assets.\n\nBut the question says \"operating portion,\" which might mean the assets directly involved in operations, so property and equipment plus operating lease assets. Let's check if there's a standard way to interpret this.\n\nIn some contexts, \"operating assets\" refer to assets used in the core business operations, which would include property, plant, equipment, and operating leases. So the sum of Property and equipment, net and Operating lease right-of-use assets.\n\nFor 2023, that would be $26,684 + $2,713 = $29,397 million.\n\nBut let's confirm if \"operating portion\" is a standard term. The question might be referring to the operating lease assets as part of the long-term assets, but the term \"operating portion\" is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets.\" Long-term assets are listed as Property and equipment, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. The \"operating portion\" might mean the part of long-term assets that are operating, which would be Property and equipment and Operating lease right-of-use assets. Other long-term assets might include non-operating items.\n\nIn the balance sheet, \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" are explicitly labeled as operating, so they are part of the operating portion. Property and equipment is also operating. So adding those two.\n\nSo for 2023:\n\nProperty and equipment, net: $26,684\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets: $2,713\n\nTotal operating portion: 26,684 + 2,713 = $29,397 million.\n\nBut let's check if the other long-term assets include any operating assets. The other long-term assets are listed as $3,718 million. From Note 10, goodwill is $994 million (as per the goodwill table: Total $994), and other intangibles might be part of other long-term assets. But goodwill is part of the business, so it's operating. However, the question might be specifically asking for the physical operating assets, excluding goodwill.\n\nBut the problem is, the question says \"operating portion,\" which in financial terms often refers to assets used in operations, which would include property, equipment, and operating leases. Goodwill is a separate item but still part of operating assets.\n\nHowever, in the context of the balance sheet, the \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" are a separate line item, so they are part of the operating assets. The property and equipment is also operating. The other long-term assets include goodwill, which is part of the business but not a physical asset. But the question might not want to include goodwill.\n\nWait, the question is from a financial reasoning agent, so I need to see what's standard. In many cases, when asked for operating assets, they mean the assets used in operations, which would be property, plant, equipment, and operating leases. So the sum of those two line items.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, the total assets are $68,994 million for 2023. The current assets are $35,879, so long-term assets would be total assets minus current assets: 68,994 - 35,879 = 33,115 million. But the long-term assets listed are 26,684 + 2,713 + 3,718 = 33,115, which matches.\n\nNow, the \"operating portion\" of long-term assets would be the part that's used in operations. The operating lease right-of-use assets are explicitly for operating leases, so they are operating. Property and equipment is operating. Other long-term assets might include non-operating, but in Costco's case, the other long-term assets include goodwill and other intangibles, which are part of the business but not physical assets. However, the question might be expecting just the property and equipment plus operating lease assets.\n\nLet me check if there's any other clue. The question is about \"operating portion,\" and in the context of the balance sheet, the operating lease assets are a separate line item. So the operating portion would be Property and equipment, net plus Operating lease right-of-use assets.\n\nSo for 2023, that's 26,684 + 2,713 = 29,397 million.\n\nBut let's confirm the numbers from the balance sheet:\n\nFor September 3, 2023 (2023):\n\n- Property and equipment, net: $26,684 million\n\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,713 million\n\nSum: 26,684 + 2,713 = 29,397 million.\n\nThe other long-term assets are $3,718 million, which includes goodwill, so they are part of the business but not the \"operating portion\" in the sense of physical assets used in operations. However, the term \"operating portion\" might be ambiguous, but given the context of the question and the line items, it's likely referring to the sum of property and equipment and operating lease assets.\n\nAnother way to check: in some financial analyses, the operating assets are calculated as total assets minus non-operating assets. But here, the question specifies \"operating portion of long-term assets,\" so it's within the long-term assets.\n\nLong-term assets consist of:\n\n- Property and equipment (operating)\n\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets (operating)\n\n- Other long-term assets (which may include non-operating)\n\nSo the operating portion would be the first two.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $29,397 million.\n\nWait, but the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets,\" so it's the portion of long-term assets that are operating. So yes, sum of the two operating items.\n\nLet me check if the other long-term assets include any operating assets. For example, if other long-term assets include deferred tax assets, which are operating, but in the balance sheet, deferred tax assets are part of other long-term assets. However, in the context of the question, \"operating portion\" likely refers to the physical assets used in operations, so property and equipment and operating leases.\n\nGiven that, the answer is 26,684 + 2,713 = 29,397.\n\nBut let's check the numbers again from the balance sheet:\n\nFor 2023 (September 3, 2023):\n\nProperty and equipment, net: $26,684\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets: $2,713\n\nOther long-term assets: $3,718\n\nSo 26,684 + 2,713 = 29,397.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe operating portion of long-term assets refers to assets directly used in core operations, which include property and equipment (net) and operating lease right-of-use assets. From the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 3, 2023:\n\n- Property and equipment, net: $26,684 million  \n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,713 million  \n\nSumming these gives the operating portion: $26,684 + $2,713 = $29,397 million.\n\n<answer>:29,397",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for in 2024. Looking at the provided financial statements, specifically the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the \"Other long-term assets\" line item. In the balance sheet for September 1, 2024, it's listed as $3,936 million. The question is asking for the portion that's \"not accounted for\" or \"we don't know what line item is for.\" \n\nWait, but the balance sheet shows \"Other long-term assets\" as a single line item. The context mentions \"the portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for.\" Hmm. Maybe there's a note or additional detail in the footnotes that breaks down what's included in \"Other long-term assets.\"\n\nLooking through the provided context, there's a note about Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets in Note 8. Wait, no, the Goodwill section is under a different note. Let me check again.\n\nIn the balance sheet, under \"OTHER ASSETS,\" there's Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. The \"Other long-term assets\" line is $3,936 million for 2024. \n\nBut the question is about the portion that's not accounted for. Maybe the company has some assets listed under \"Other long-term assets\" that aren't specified. However, in the provided financial statements, the \"Other long-term assets\" line is a single line item. The notes might explain what's included. \n\nLooking at the notes, there's a note about Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets. The note says: \"Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\" So, the goodwill is part of the \"Other long-term assets\" line. \n\nThe balance sheet shows \"Other long-term assets\" as $3,936 million. The note states that goodwill is included here. The goodwill amount is $994 million (from the Goodwill table: United States $953, Canada $26, Other International $15, totaling $994). \n\nSo, if goodwill is part of \"Other long-term assets,\" then the remaining portion would be \"Other long-term assets\" minus goodwill. Let's calculate that: $3,936 - $994 = $2,942 million. \n\nBut the question is asking for the portion that's \"not accounted for,\" meaning the part that's not specified. If goodwill is a specific item included in \"Other long-term assets,\" then the remaining amount would be the unaccounted portion. \n\nWait, the question says \"the portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for, that we don't know what line item is for.\" So, the \"Other long-term assets\" line includes goodwill (which is accounted for) and other items. The \"not accounted for\" part would be the amount not specified, which is the total \"Other long-term assets\" minus the known components like goodwill. \n\nFrom the Goodwill note, the goodwill is $994 million. So, the other portion would be $3,936 - $994 = $2,942 million. \n\nBut let me confirm if there are other components. The notes also mention \"Definite-lived intangible assets, which are immaterial, are included in other long-term assets.\" So, the immaterial intangible assets are part of \"Other long-term assets,\" but since they're immaterial, they might not affect the calculation. The main known component is goodwill. \n\nTherefore, the portion not accounted for (i.e., the part that's not goodwill or other specified items) would be $3,936 - $994 = $2,942 million. \n\nWait, but the question says \"the portion... that's not accounted for, that we don't know what line item is for.\" So, if goodwill is accounted for (as it's a specific line item in the notes), then the rest is the unaccounted portion. \n\nYes, so the answer should be $2,942 million. But let's check the numbers again. \n\nIn the balance sheet, Other long-term assets 2024: $3,936 million. \n\nGoodwill from the table: $994 million. \n\nSo, 3,936 - 994 = 2,942. \n\nTherefore, the portion not accounted for is $2,942 million.\n</think>\n\nThe \"Other long-term assets\" line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for September 1, 2024, is $3,936 million. This includes goodwill, which is explicitly stated in Note 8 (Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets) as $994 million (sum of $953 + $26 + $15). The remaining portion of \"Other long-term assets\" not accounted for as goodwill or other specified items (e.g., immaterial definite-lived intangibles) is calculated as $3,936 - $994 = $2,942 million.\n\n<answer>:2,942",

      "ground_truth": "$456 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"What is the operating portion of long-term liabilities in 2024?\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"operating portion of long-term liabilities\" means. In financial statements, long-term liabilities are typically split into operating and financing components. Operating liabilities are those related to the company's core business operations, like accounts payable, deferred revenue, etc., while financing liabilities are debt-related.\n\nLooking at Costco's balance sheet for 2024 (September 1, 2024), the liabilities section shows:\n\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375 million\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576 million\n\nThe key here is \"operating portion.\" In lease accounting, operating leases are treated as operating liabilities, whereas finance leases are financing. The balance sheet lists \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" as $2,375 million. This is likely the operating portion.\n\nWait, but the question says \"operating portion of long-term liabilities.\" The term \"operating portion\" might refer to the part of long-term liabilities that are operating in nature, not financing. For Costco, the operating lease liabilities are a major component. The \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" line item is specifically labeled as such, so that should be the operating portion.\n\nLet me check the notes. In Note 5—Leases, it says:\n\"Long-term operating lease liabilities $2,375 $2,426\"\n\nSo, the long-term operating lease liabilities are $2,375 million as of 2024. The other long-term liabilities ($2,576 million) might include things like deferred tax liabilities, pension obligations, etc., which could be a mix. But the question specifies \"operating portion,\" which typically refers to operating leases.\n\nIn the balance sheet, \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" is a separate line item under \"Other Liabilities,\" so that's the operating part. The other long-term liabilities might include both operating and financing, but the operating lease liability is explicitly called out.\n\nTherefore, the operating portion of long-term liabilities should be the long-term operating lease liabilities of $2,375 million.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The question says \"operating portion of long-term liabilities.\" In some contexts, \"operating liabilities\" include things like accounts payable, accrued expenses, etc., but those are current liabilities. The long-term operating liabilities would be the long-term part of those, but in Costco's case, the balance sheet lists \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" as a specific line item. \n\nLooking at the balance sheet structure:\n- Current liabilities include \"Deferred membership fees\" and \"Accrued member rewards,\" which are operating.\n- Long-term liabilities include \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" and \"Other long-term liabilities.\"\n\nSo, the \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" is the operating portion of long-term liabilities. The other long-term liabilities might include non-operating items like debt, but the operating lease is explicitly labeled.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $2,375 million.\n\nWait, but the question says \"operating portion of long-term liabilities.\" Let me check if there's another component. For example, deferred revenue (membership fees) is a current liability, but the deferred membership fees are $2,501 million (current) and the long-term part might be included in other long-term liabilities. However, the balance sheet shows \"Deferred membership fees\" as a current liability, so the long-term portion would be part of \"Other long-term liabilities.\"\n\nBut the question is about the \"operating portion,\" and operating leases are a standard operating liability. The lease liabilities are a key part of operating liabilities for companies with leases.\n\nIn the lease note (Note 5), it's clear that operating lease liabilities are separate from finance lease liabilities. The operating lease liabilities are $2,375 million as long-term.\n\nSo, the answer should be $2,375 million.\n\nDouble-checking the balance sheet:\n\nUnder \"OTHER LIABILITIES\":\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576\n\nSo, the \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" is $2,375, which is the operating portion. The other long-term liabilities might include things like deferred tax liabilities, which are not operating, but the operating lease is specifically called out.\n\nTherefore, the operating portion of long-term liabilities is $2,375 million.\n</think>\n\nThe operating portion of long-term liabilities refers to long-term operating lease liabilities, which are explicitly listed in Costco's balance sheet under \"Other Liabilities\" as $2,375 million for 2024. This is distinct from financing-related liabilities like long-term debt.\n\n<answer>:2,375",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"What is the operating portion of long-term liabilities in 2023?\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"operating portion of long-term liabilities\" means. In financial statements, long-term liabilities are typically split into operating and financing components. Operating liabilities are those related to the company's core operations, like accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue. Financing liabilities are debt-related, like long-term debt.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements for Costco, specifically the Consolidated Balance Sheets for 2023 (September 3, 2023), I need to find the long-term liabilities that are operating in nature.\n\nThe balance sheet shows:\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,377 million\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,426 million\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,550 million\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these are operating. \n\nLong-term debt is clearly a financing liability, as it's related to borrowing money. The \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" are specifically labeled as operating, so that's part of the operating portion. \n\nThe \"Other long-term liabilities\" might include both operating and financing items, but the note about leases (Note 5) indicates that operating lease liabilities are separate. The operating lease liabilities are listed under \"Other Liabilities\" as \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" at $2,426 million for 2023.\n\nThe question asks for the \"operating portion of long-term liabilities.\" In lease accounting, operating leases are considered operating liabilities, whereas finance leases (which are capitalized) are part of financing. However, in the balance sheet, the operating lease liabilities are explicitly listed as \"Long-term operating lease liabilities,\" so that should be the operating portion.\n\nWait, but the question says \"operating portion of long-term liabilities.\" So, the long-term liabilities include:\n- Long-term debt (financing)\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities (operating)\n- Other long-term liabilities (which might include things like deferred tax liabilities, pension obligations, etc.)\n\nBut the key here is that the operating lease liabilities are specifically identified as operating. The other long-term liabilities might include both operating and non-operating items.

The deferred tax liabilities are part of the \"Other long-term liabilities\" but are not operating. The operating portion would be the operating lease liabilities.\n\nWait, but the question is about \"operating portion of long-term liabilities.\" In some contexts, operating liabilities include things like accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue, etc. But in the balance sheet provided, the current portion of long-term debt is listed under current liabilities, and the long-term debt is separate.\n\nWait, the balance sheet shows:\n- Current liabilities: includes \"Current portion of long-term debt\" at $1,081 million (2023)\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,377 million (2023)\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,426 million (2023)\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,550 million (2023)\n\nSo, the total long-term liabilities would be: $5,377 (long-term debt) + $2,426 (operating lease) + $2,550 (other) = $10,353 million.\n\nBut the \"operating portion\" would be the operating lease liabilities, which are $2,426 million. The other long-term liabilities might include both operating and non-operating items, but the operating lease is explicitly labeled as operating.\n\nIn lease accounting, operating leases are treated as operating liabilities, whereas finance leases are part of financing. The note 5 states that the operating lease liabilities are included in \"other long-term liabilities\" on the balance sheet. So, the \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" line item is the operating portion.\n\nTherefore, the operating portion of long-term liabilities in 2023 is $2,426 million.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The question says \"operating portion of long-term liabilities.\" In some contexts, \"operating liabilities\" refer to liabilities arising from operations, like accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue. But in this case, the balance sheet lists \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" as a separate line item under \"Other Liabilities,\" so that's the specific operating component.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet structure:\n- Current liabilities include \"Deferred membership fees\" which is an operating liability (since membership fees are part of operations).\n- Long-term liabilities include \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" as a specific line.\n\nSo, the operating portion of long-term liabilities is the \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" amount, which is $2,426 million for 2023.\n\nConfirming the numbers from the balance sheet:\nFor 2023 (September 3, 2023):\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,426 million\n\nYes, that's the figure. The other long-term liabilities ($2,550 million) likely include things like deferred tax liabilities, which are not operating. So the operating portion is specifically the operating lease liabilities.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $2,426 million.\n</think>\n\nThe operating portion of long-term liabilities refers to long-term operating lease liabilities, which are explicitly identified in the balance sheet.

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities in 2024.\" Hmm, I need to parse that correctly.\n\nFirst, I should look at the financial statements provided. The question mentions \"operating portion of long-term assets\" and \"net long-term liabilities.\" Wait, \"net long-term liabilities\" might be a bit confusing. Typically, net long-term liabilities would be long-term liabilities minus long-term assets, but that doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's asking for the operating part of long-term assets and then net long-term liabilities separately? Or perhaps it's a typo and they mean the operating lease assets and the net long-term liabilities.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, under \"OTHER ASSETS,\" there's \"Property and equipment, net\" at $29,032 million for 2024. Then there's \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" at $2,617 million. The question says \"operating portion of long-term assets,\" so maybe they're referring to the operating lease assets as part of the operating assets. But \"operating portion\" might mean excluding non-operating assets. However, in the context of Costco's balance sheet, the operating lease right-of-use assets are part of operating assets.\n\nWait, the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets.\" Long-term assets would include property and equipment, operating lease assets, etc. But \"operating portion\" might refer to the assets used in operations, which would include both property and equipment and operating lease assets. But the question is phrased as \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities.\" Maybe it's two separate items: the operating portion (which might be the operating lease assets) and net long-term liabilities.\n\nWait, \"net long-term liabilities\" – typically, net liabilities would be total liabilities minus assets, but that's not standard. Maybe they mean the long-term liabilities minus long-term assets? But that's not common. Alternatively, \"net long-term liabilities\" might refer to the long-term liabilities as presented on the balance sheet, which would be the total long-term liabilities minus current portion. Wait, in the balance sheet, under \"OTHER LIABILITIES,\" there's \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" at $5,794 million, \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" at $2,375 million, and \"Other long-term liabilities\" at $2,576 million. So total long-term liabilities would be $5,794 + $2,375 + $2,576 = $10,745 million. But \"net long-term liabilities\" might mean that, but the question says \"net,\" so maybe it's the net of long-term assets and liabilities? But that's unclear.\n\nWait, the question might be misphrased. Let me check the original question again: \"What is the operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities in 2024?\"\n\nWait, maybe it's asking for two things: the operating portion of long-term assets (which would be the operating lease right-of-use assets, since those are part of operating leases), and then net long-term liabilities. But \"net long-term liabilities\" is confusing. Alternatively, maybe \"operating portion of long-term assets\" refers to the operating lease assets, and \"net long-term liabilities\" refers to the long-term liabilities minus the operating lease liabilities? But that's a stretch.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, the \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" are listed under \"OTHER ASSETS\" as $2,617 million. That's the operating lease asset. Then, under \"OTHER LIABILITIES,\" \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" are $2,375 million. So perhaps the \"operating portion of long-term assets\" is the operating lease right-of-use assets, and \"net long-term liabilities\" might refer to the long-term operating lease liabilities. But the question says \"net long-term liabilities,\" which might be a misnomer.\n\nWait, the term \"net long-term liabilities\" isn't standard. Usually, you have total long-term liabilities, and sometimes \"net\" refers to after subtracting assets, but that's not typical. Maybe the question is asking for the operating lease assets (as the operating portion of long-term assets) and the long-term operating lease liabilities (as the net long-term liabilities related to operations). But the question is phrased as a single number, so maybe it's a single figure.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the \"operating portion of long-term assets\" which is the operating lease right-of-use assets, and \"net long-term liabilities\" which might be the long-term debt minus current portion, but that's not related. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they want the operating lease assets and the operating lease liabilities, but the question says \"net,\" so maybe the difference between them? But that's not standard.\n\nWait, looking at the balance sheet, the \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" are $2,617 million. The \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" are $2,375 million. But the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets\" – so the operating lease assets are part of the long-term assets. So the operating portion would be $2,617 million. Then \"net long-term liabilities\" – perhaps they mean the long-term liabilities related to operations, which would be the long-term operating lease liabilities of $2,375 million. But the question is phrased as a single answer, so maybe it's asking for the operating lease assets, which is $2,617 million.\n\nWait, but the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities.\" Maybe it's a misread, and they want the operating lease assets (as the operating portion) and the net long-term liabilities (which might be the long-term liabilities minus current portion, but that's $5,794 million for debt, but that's not related to operating leases).\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"net long-term liabilities\" refers to the long-term liabilities minus the operating lease liabilities, but that's not standard. Let me check the balance sheet again.\n\nIn the balance sheet, under \"TOTAL LIABILITIES,\" it's $46,209 million. The current liabilities are $35,464 million, so long-term liabilities would be $46,209 - $35,464 = $10,745 million. But that's total long-term liabilities. However, the question says \"net long-term liabilities,\" which might be a mistake, and they just want the long-term liabilities. But the question mentions \"operating portion,\" so perhaps it's the operating lease liabilities.\n\nWait, the note 5 on leases says that operating lease liabilities are $2,375 million (long-term) and $179 million (current). So the long-term operating lease liabilities are $2,375 million. The operating lease right-of-use assets are $2,617 million.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities.\" Maybe \"operating portion of long-term assets\" refers to the operating lease assets, which is $2,617 million, and \"net long-term liabilities\" refers to the long-term operating lease liabilities, $2,375 million. But the question seems to be asking for a single number. Wait, maybe it's a typo and they want the operating lease assets, which is the operating portion of long-term assets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"net long-term liabilities\" is a misstatement, and they want the long-term debt excluding current portion, which is $5,794 million. But that's not related to operating.\n\nWait, the user's question might have a typo. Let me check the original context again. The balance sheet shows:\n\nOTHER ASSETS:\nProperty and equipment, net $29,032\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $2,617\nOther long-term assets $3,936\n\nSo the operating lease right-of-use assets are part of the long-term assets. So the \"operating portion\" would be the operating lease assets, which is $2,617 million.\n\nThen \"net long-term liabilities\" – perhaps they mean the long-term liabilities related to operations, which would be the long-term operating lease liabilities of $2,375 million. But the question is asking for a single number, so maybe it's the operating lease assets, as that's the \"operating portion of long-term assets.\"\n\nWait, the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities.\" Maybe it's two separate items, but the way it's phrased, it's a single answer. Maybe the user made a mistake, and it's supposed to be \"operating lease assets\" and \"long-term operating lease liabilities,\" but the question is written as one.\n\nAlternatively, in some contexts, \"net long-term liabilities\" might refer to the net of long-term assets and liabilities, but that's not standard. For example, if you have long-term assets and long-term liabilities, net would be assets minus liabilities. But the operating lease assets are $2,617, and operating lease liabilities are $2,375, so net would be $242. But that's a stretch.\n\nWait, looking at the lease note (Note 5), it says:\n\n\"Operating lease liabilities $ 2,375 $ 2,426\"\n\nAnd the operating lease right-of-use assets are $2,617.\n\nBut the question is asking for \"operating portion of long-term assets\" which would be the operating lease assets, so $2,617 million. The \"net long-term liabilities\" part might be a red herring or a mistake. Maybe the question meant to ask for the operating lease assets, which is a common figure to report.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"net long-term liabilities\" refers to the long-term debt excluding current portion, which is $5,794 million. But that's not related to operating.\n\nWait, the user's question might have a typo. Let's see the exact wording: \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities.\" Maybe it's supposed to be \"operating lease assets and net long-term liabilities,\" but the user combined them. However, the answer is likely the operating lease right-of-use assets, which is $2,617 million.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, the \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" is listed under OTHER ASSETS as $2,617 million for 2024. That's the operating portion (since it's related to operating leases) of long-term assets. The \"net long-term liabilities\" might be a mistake, but the question is probably asking for the operating lease assets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"net long-term liabilities\" refers to the long-term liabilities minus the current portion, which is $5,794 million (long-term debt excluding current portion), but that's not related to operating.\n\nGiven that the question mentions \"operating portion,\" the key figure is the operating lease right-of-use assets. So the answer should be $2,617 million.\n\nWait, but the question says \"net long-term liabilities,\" which might be confusing. Let me check if there's a \"net\" in the balance sheet. The balance sheet lists \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" as $5,794, which is a net figure (excluding current portion). But that's not related to operating.\n\nAnother angle: \"operating portion of long-term assets\" – long-term assets include property and equipment, operating lease assets, etc. The operating portion would be the part used in operations, which for leases is the right-of-use asset. So $2,617 million.\n\nI think the intended answer is the operating lease right-of-use assets, which is $2,617 million. The \"net long-term liabilities\" part might be a mistake in the question, or perhaps it's a misread of the balance sheet line items.\n\nSo, based on the balance sheet, the operating lease right-of-use assets are $2,617 million. That's the operating portion of long-term assets. The \"net long-term liabilities\" might be a distractor, but the question likely wants the operating lease assets.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $2,617 million.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:2,617",

      "ground_truth": "$33,577 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities in 2023.\" Hmm, I need to parse that correctly.\n\nFirst, I should look at the financial statements provided. The question mentions \"operating portion of long-term assets\" and \"net long-term liabilities.\" Wait, but the term \"operating portion\" might refer to assets and liabilities related to operations, not financing. But in the balance sheet, long-term assets are usually listed under \"Other Assets\" or similar.\n\nLooking at the Consolidated Balance Sheets for 2023 (September 3, 2023), the assets section shows:\n\n- Property and equipment, net: $26,684 million\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,713 million\n- Other long-term assets: $3,718 million\n\nTotal long-term assets would be the sum of these. But the question specifies \"operating portion.\" Operating lease right-of-use assets are part of operating assets, right? Because operating leases are for the use of assets in operations. So maybe the operating portion refers to the operating lease assets plus property and equipment, but excluding other long-term assets like goodwill or intangibles.\n\nWait, the note says \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" are listed under \"Other Assets\" as $2,713 million in 2023. Property and equipment is separate. So total operating assets might be property and equipment plus operating lease assets. But the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets,\" which might mean the part of long-term assets used in operations, which would include both property and equipment and operating leases.\n\nBut the question also says \"net long-term liabilities.\" So net long-term liabilities would be long-term liabilities minus long-term assets? Wait, no. Net long-term liabilities usually mean total long-term liabilities minus long-term assets, but that's not standard. Wait, maybe it's asking for the net of long-term liabilities, but the phrasing is confusing.\n\nWait, the question is \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities.\" Maybe it's a typo or misphrasing. Perhaps it's asking for the operating portion of long-term assets (like operating lease assets) and net long-term liabilities (total long-term liabilities minus current portion). But the way it's written is a bit unclear.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, long-term liabilities for 2023 are:\n\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,377 million\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,426 million\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,550 million\n- Total liabilities: $43,936 million (but that's total liabilities, including current)\n\nWait, the \"Other Liabilities\" section shows:\n\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,377\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,426\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,550\n- Total liabilities: $43,936 (but that's total liabilities, which includes current liabilities)\n\nWait, no. The \"TOTAL LIABILITIES\" is $43,936, which includes current liabilities ($33,583) and other liabilities ($10,353, which is 5,377 + 2,426 + 2,550 = 10,353). So total long-term liabilities would be $10,353 million.\n\nBut the question says \"net long-term liabilities.\" Net usually means after subtracting assets, but that's not standard. Wait, maybe it's a misphrase, and they want the long-term liabilities (excluding current portion), which is $5,377 (debt) + $2,426 (operating lease liabilities) + $2,550 (other) = $10,353 million.\n\nBut the question mentions \"operating portion of long-term assets.\" So perhaps they want the operating lease right-of-use assets (which are part of long-term assets) and the operating lease liabilities (long-term operating lease liabilities). But the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets\" and \"net long-term liabilities,\" so maybe it's two separate things.\n\nWait, the exact question: \"What is the operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities in 2023?\"\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and they mean \"operating portion of long-term assets and net long-term liabilities,\" but that's two items. But the answer is likely a single number, so perhaps it's the net of operating lease assets minus operating lease liabilities.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, operating lease right-of-use assets are $2,713 million (2023), and long-term operating lease liabilities are $2,426 million. So net operating lease assets would be 2,713 - 2,426 = $287 million. But that's just the operating lease part.\n\nBut the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets\" which might refer to the operating lease assets, and \"net long-term liabilities\" which might be total long-term liabilities minus something. But \"net long-term liabilities\" usually means total long-term liabilities, but \"net\" might imply after subtracting assets.\n\nWait, in some contexts, \"net long-term liabilities\" could mean long-term liabilities minus long-term assets, but that's not standard. Let's check the balance sheet.\n\nTotal long-term assets (excluding current assets) would be:\n\nProperty and equipment, net: $26,684\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets: $2,713\n\nOther long-term assets: $3,718\n\nTotal long-term assets: 26,684 + 2,713 + 3,718 = $33,115 million.\n\nTotal long-term liabilities: $5,377 (debt) + $2,426 (operating lease) + $2,550 (other) = $10,353 million.\n\nSo net long-term liabilities would be long-term liabilities minus long-term assets? But that would be negative, which doesn't make sense. Usually, net liabilities would be total liabilities minus total assets, but that's not what's asked.\n\nWait, the question might be misphrased. Maybe it's asking for the \"operating lease right-of-use assets\" (which is the operating portion of long-term assets related to leases) and \"net long-term liabilities\" which might refer to the long-term debt excluding current portion. But the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities,\" so perhaps it's two numbers, but the answer is expected to be a single number.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement, the user says \"provide the final answer,\" implying a single number. So maybe it's the operating lease right-of-use assets minus the long-term operating lease liabilities, which is a common way to present net operating lease assets.\n\nIn the balance sheet, operating lease right-of-use assets are $2,713 million (2023), and long-term operating lease liabilities are $2,426 million. So net would be 2,713 - 2,426 = $287 million.\n\nBut let's check the notes. In Note 5, it says:\n\n\"Operating lease liabilities $ 2,375 $ 2,426\"\n\nSo for 2023, long-term operating lease liabilities are $2,426 million.\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets for 2023 are $2,713 million.\n\nSo the net operating lease assets would be 2,713 - 2,426 = $287 million.\n\nBut the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities.\" Maybe \"operating portion\" refers to the operating lease assets, and \"net long-term liabilities\" refers to the net of operating lease liabilities. But \"net long-term liabilities\" might be a misnomer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the \"net long-term liabilities\" which is total long-term liabilities, but that's $10,353 million. But that seems too large, and the question mentions \"operating portion,\" so probably related to operating leases.\n\nAnother angle: In some contexts, \"operating portion\" might refer to assets used in operations, which would include property and equipment and operating leases. But the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets,\" so perhaps the operating lease assets are part of that.\n\nWait, the problem might be a misread. Let me check the exact wording again: \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities.\"\n\nPerhaps it's a typo and should be \"operating lease assets and net long-term liabilities,\" but the answer is likely the net operating lease assets, which is $287 million.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"net long-term liabilities\" refers to long-term debt excluding current portion, which is $5,377 million. But the question says \"operating portion,\" so probably related to operating leases.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, the operating lease right-of-use assets are $2,713 million (2023), and the long-term operating lease liabilities are $2,426 million. So the net would be $287 million.\n\nI think that's the intended answer. The question might be phrased poorly, but in financial contexts, the net operating lease asset is often reported as the right-of-use asset minus the lease liability.\n\nSo for 2023, operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,713 million\n\nLong-term operating lease liabilities: $2,426 million\n\nNet: $287 million.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $287 million.\n\nWait, but the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities.\" Maybe it's two separate items, but the answer is expected to be a single number. Given the context, I think the net operating lease asset is the intended answer.\n\nLet me confirm with the numbers:\n\n2023 Balance Sheet:\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets: $2,713\n\nLong-term operating lease liabilities: $2,426\n\nNet: 2,713 - 2,426 = 287.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final answer is $287 million.\n</think>\n\nThe question asks for the \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities in 2023.\" This refers to the net operating lease assets, calculated as operating lease right-of-use assets minus long-term operating lease liabilities. From the 2023 balance sheet:\n\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,713 million\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,426 million\n\nNet operating lease assets = $2,713 - $2,426 = $287 million.\n\n<answer>:287",

      "ground_truth": "$2,506 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this question about Costco's change in operating portion of long-term assets and net long-term liabilities from 2023 to 2024. \n\nFirst, I need to understand exactly what the question is asking. It's asking for the change in two specific items: \"operating portion of long-term assets\" and \"net long-term liabilities.\" But looking at the financial statements provided, I need to figure out which line items correspond to these.\n\nHmm, the balance sheet shows \"Property and equipment, net\" as $29,032 million in 2024 and $26,684 million in 2023. That seems like a key long-term asset. Then there's \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" at $2,617 million (2024) and $2,713 million (2023). \n\nFor liabilities, \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" is $5,794 million (2024) vs $5,377 million (2023), and \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" is $2,375 million (2024) vs $2,426 million (2023).\n\nWait, the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets\" - that probably refers to the operating lease right-of-use assets since those are part of operating leases. And \"net long-term liabilities\" would be long-term debt plus long-term operating lease liabilities minus any offsets.\n\nLet me calculate the changes:\n\nFor operating lease right-of-use assets (long-term assets):\n2024: $2,617\n2023: $2,713\nChange: $2,617 - $2,713 = -$96 million (decrease)\n\nFor net long-term liabilities:\nLong-term debt (excl current): $5,794 - $5,377 = +$417 million\nLong-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375 - $2,426 = -$51 million\nNet change: $417 - $51 = +$366 million\n\nBut the question asks for \"change in operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities\" - this phrasing is a bit confusing. It might be asking for the change in the operating portion of long-term assets (which would be the operating lease assets) and separately the change in net long-term liabilities.\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" is listed under \"OTHER ASSETS\" as $2,617 million (2024) and $2,713 million (2023). So the change in this operating asset is -$96 million.\n\nFor \"net long-term liabilities,\" I think this refers to long-term debt plus long-term operating lease liabilities. So:\n2024: $5,794 (long-term debt) + $2,375 (long-term operating lease liabilities) = $8,169 million\n2023: $5,377 + $2,426 = $7,803 million\nChange: $8,169 - $7,803 = +$366 million\n\nBut the question says \"net long-term liabilities\" - in accounting, \"net\" might mean after subtracting assets, but that doesn't make sense here. I think it's just asking for the change in long-term liabilities.\n\nWait, looking at the balance sheet, \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" is $5,794 and \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" is $2,375, so total long-term liabilities would be these two plus other long-term liabilities ($2,576 in 2024). But the question specifies \"net long-term liabilities,\" which might mean just the debt and lease liabilities.\n\nThe question is phrased as \"change in operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities\" - this seems like it might be asking for two separate changes: the change in operating portion of long-term assets, and the change in net long-term liabilities.\n\nSo:\n- Operating portion of long-term assets (operating lease right-of-use assets): change = $2,617 - $2,713 = -$96 million\n- Net long-term liabilities (long-term debt + long-term operating lease liabilities): change = ($5,794 + $2,375) - ($5,377 + $2,426) = $8,169 - $7,803 = +$366 million\n\nBut the question says \"the change in... from 2023 to 2024\" - so it's asking for the difference between 2024 and 2023.\n\nI should check if there's any other item that might be considered \"operating portion of long-term assets.\" The balance sheet shows \"Property and equipment, net\" as $29,032 million (2024) vs $26,684 million (2023), but that's not specifically the \"operating portion\" - it's all property and equipment.\n\nThe term \"operating portion\" likely refers to the operating lease assets, as those are specifically for operating leases.\n\nFor \"net long-term liabilities,\" in the balance sheet, \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" is $5,794 and \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" is $2,375, so total long-term liabilities related to operations would be these two.\n\nSo the change in operating lease right-of-use assets is -$96 million, and the change in long-term debt + long-term operating lease liabilities is +$366 million.\n\nBut the question asks for \"the change in operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities\" - this phrasing is a bit ambiguous. It might be asking for the change in the operating portion of long-term assets (which is the operating lease assets) and separately the change in net long-term liabilities.\n\nLooking at the exact wording: \"change in operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities\" - the comma might be separating two items: (1) operating portion of long-term assets, and (2) net long-term liabilities.\n\nSo I think the answer should be two numbers: the change in operating lease assets and the change in net long-term liabilities.\n\nBut the question says \"the change\" (singular), so maybe it's asking for the net change of these two items combined? That doesn't make much sense.\n\nPerhaps \"net long-term liabilities\" refers to long-term liabilities minus long-term assets, but that would be unusual.\n\nAnother possibility: \"operating portion of long-term assets\" might refer to the operating lease assets, and \"net long-term liabilities\" might refer to long-term debt minus operating lease liabilities or something.\n\nLet me look at the balance sheet again:\n\nLiabilities:\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 (2024)\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375 (2024)\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576 (2024)\n\nSo total long-term liabilities = $5,794 + $2,375 + $2,576 = $10,745 million\n\nBut the question says \"net long-term liabilities\" - in some contexts, \"net\" might mean after subtracting assets, but that's not standard.\n\nPerhaps \"net long-term liabilities\" refers to long-term debt net of operating lease liabilities, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think the most straightforward interpretation is:\n- \"Operating portion of long-term assets\" = operating lease right-of-use assets\n- \"Net long-term liabilities\" = long-term debt (excluding current portion) + long-term operating lease liabilities\n\nSo:\nChange in operating lease assets: $2,617 - $2,713 = -$96 million\nChange in net long-term liabilities: ($5,794 + $2,375) - ($5,377 + $2,426) = $8,169 - $7,803 = +$366 million\n\nBut the question asks for \"the change\" (singular), so maybe it's asking for the sum of these two changes? That would be -$96 + $366 = +$270 million, but that seems odd.\n\nPerhaps the question is misphrased, and it's asking for the change in the operating portion of long-term assets (which is the operating lease assets) and separately the change in net long-term liabilities.\n\nBut the way it's written, it's \"the change in [A, B]\" which might mean the change in A and the change in B.\n\nHowever, the instruction says \"provide the final answer\" - so it's probably expecting a single number.\n\nLet me check if there's a line item called \"net long-term liabilities\" in the balance sheet. Looking at the balance sheet, there's \"Total Liabilities\" but not \"net long-term liabilities.\"\n\nAnother thought: \"net long-term liabilities\" might refer to long-term debt minus long-term assets, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps \"net long-term liabilities\" is a standard term meaning long-term liabilities minus long-term assets, but I'm not sure.\n\nIn some contexts, \"net long-term liabilities\" could mean the net of long-term liabilities and long-term assets, but that would be unusual.\n\nLet's calculate that:\nLong-term assets (operating lease right-of-use assets): $2,617 (2024)\nLong-term liabilities (long-term debt + long-term operating lease liabilities): $5,794 + $2,375 = $8,169 (2024)\nNet long-term liabilities = $8,169 - $2,617 = $5,552 million\n\n2023:\nLong-term assets: $2,713\nLong-term liabilities: $5,377 + $2,426 = $7,803\nNet long-term liabilities: $7,803 - $2,713 = $5,090 million\n\nChange: $5,552 - $5,090 = +$462 million\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is what the question means by \"net long-term liabilities.\"\n\nThe question says \"net long-term liabilities,\" not \"net of long-term assets and liabilities.\"\n\nI think I should stick to the most common interpretation.\n\nLet me look for similar terms in the financial statements. In the balance sheet, they have \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" and \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" as separate line items.\n\nThe term \"net long-term liabilities\" isn't used, so I think the question is asking for the change in two things:\n1. Operating portion of long-term assets (operating lease right-of-use assets)\n2. Net long-term liabilities (which would be long-term debt + long-term operating lease liabilities)\n\nSo the answer should be two numbers: -96 and +366.\n\nBut the question says \"the change,\" so maybe it's asking for the change in the operating portion (which is -96) and separately the change in net long-term liabilities (which is +366), but since it's a single answer, perhaps they want the sum or something.\n\nWait, the question says \"change in operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities\" - the comma might be separating the two items, so it's asking for the change in each.\n\nBut the instruction says \"provide the final answer,\" so it's probably expecting a single number.\n\nPerhaps \"net long-term liabilities\" refers to the net of long-term debt and operating lease liabilities, but that would be unusual.\n\nAnother idea: \"net long-term liabilities\" might mean long-term debt minus operating lease liabilities, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's calculate the change in long-term debt: $5,794 - $5,377 = +$417 million\nChange in operating lease liabilities: $2,375 - $2,426 = -$51 million\nNet change in these two: +$417 - $51 = +$366 million\n\nAnd for assets, change in operating lease assets: -$96 million\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"change in [A, B]\", so it's likely asking for two separate changes.\n\nHowever, the instruction says \"the final answer,\" so it's probably a single number.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look at the balance sheet again.\n\nThe balance sheet has:\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,617 (2024), $2,713 (2023) → change = -$96\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 (2024), $5,377 (2023) → change = +$417\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375 (2024), $2,426 (2023) → change = -$51\n\n\"Net long-term liabilities\" might mean the sum of long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities, so net change is +$417 - $51 = +$366.\n\nBut the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities\" - so it's two things: the change in operating assets and the change in net liabilities.\n\nSince the question asks for \"the change,\" and it's a single answer, I think they want the change in the operating lease assets (which is the operating portion of long-term assets), and \"net long-term liabilities\" might be a misnomer.\n\nWait, the question says \"operating portion of long-term assets\" - that's one item, and \"net long-term liabilities\" is another item. So the answer should be two numbers.\n\nBut the instruction says \"provide the final answer,\" so it's probably expecting a single number, which suggests I might be misunderstanding.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"What is the change in operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities from 2023 to 2024?\"\n\nPerhaps \"net long-term liabilities\" is a single item, and \"operating portion of long-term assets\" is another, but the way it's written, it's \"operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities\" - so it's two items.\n\nIn financial reporting, \"net long-term liabilities\" isn't a standard term, but \"long-term liabilities\" is.\n\nAnother possibility: \"net long-term liabilities\" might refer to the net of long-term liabilities and long-term assets, but that would be unusual.\n\nLet's calculate the change in \"net long-term liabilities\" as long-term liabilities minus long-term assets.\n\nLong-term liabilities (as per balance sheet):\n- Long-term debt: $5,794\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576\nTotal long-term liabilities = $5,794 + $2,375 + $2,576 = $10,745 million (2024)\nLong-term assets (operating lease right-of-use assets): $2,617 million (2024)\nNet long-term liabilities = $10,745 - $2,617 = $8,128 million\n\n2023:\nLong-term liabilities = $5,377 + $2,426 + $2,550 = $10,353 million\nLong-term assets = $2,713 million\nNet long-term liabilities = $10,353 - $2,713 = $7,640 million\n\nChange: $8,128 - $7,640 = +$488 million\n\nBut this seems like a stretch.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking for the change in the operating lease right-of-use assets (which is the operating portion of long-term assets) and the change in long-term debt (which is part of long-term liabilities), but it's not clear.\n\nLet's look at the cash flow statement for clues. In the cash flow statement, there's \"Non-cash lease expense\" and \"Operating lease costs,\" which confirms that operating lease assets and liabilities are significant.\n\nI think the most reasonable interpretation is:\n- \"Operating portion of long-term assets\" refers to operating lease right-of-use assets\n- \"Net long-term liabilities\" refers to long-term debt plus long-term operating lease liabilities\n\nSo the change in operating lease assets is -$96 million\nThe change in net long-term liabilities is +$366 million\n\nBut since the question asks for \"the change,\" and it's a single answer, perhaps they want the change in the operating lease assets, as that's the \"operating portion,\" and \"net long-term liabilities\" might be a red herring or misphrased.\n\nWait, the question says \"change in operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities\" - the comma might be separating two different things, but in financial terms, \"net long-term liabilities\" might mean the net of long-term liabilities.\n\nI recall that in some contexts, \"net long-term liabilities\" means long-term liabilities minus long-term assets, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet's check the balance sheet for \"net\" items. The balance sheet has \"Property and equipment, net\" and \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" (not net), so \"net\" is used for property and equipment.\n\nFor liabilities, they don't have \"net\" in the title.\n\nPerhaps the question has a typo, and it's asking for the change in operating lease assets and the change in long-term debt.\n\nBut the question specifically says \"net long-term liabilities.\"\n\nAnother idea: \"net long-term liabilities\" might refer to the long-term debt excluding the current portion, which is a standard term.\n\nIn the balance sheet, \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" is $5,794 million (2024), $5,377 million (2023), so change is +$417 million.\n\nAnd \"operating portion of long-term assets\" is operating lease right-of-use assets, change of -$96 million.\n\nBut the question is asking for \"the change in [A, B]\", so it's two numbers.\n\nGiven that the instruction says \"provide the final answer,\" and it's a single number, I think I need to see if there's a standard way to interpret this.\n\nPerhaps \"operating portion of long-term assets\" is a misnomer, and they mean the operating lease assets, and \"net long-term liabilities\" means the long-term debt.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's look at the answer format. The instruction says \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\"\n\nSo it's probably a single number with a sign.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that the operating lease assets decreased by $96 million, and long-term debt increased by $417 million, but the question mentions \"net long-term liabilities,\" which might be the net of debt and lease liabilities.\n\nI think the safest bet is to calculate the change in operating lease right-of-use assets, as that's the \"operating portion of long-term assets,\" and ignore \"net long-term liabilities\" as a misphrasing, or assume it's a separate item.\n\nBut the question includes both, so I need to include both.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking for the change in the operating portion of long-term assets (which is the operating lease assets) and the change in net long-term liabilities (which is long-term debt minus operating lease liabilities or something).\n\nLet's calculate the change in long-term debt: +$417 million\nChange in operating lease liabilities: -$51 million\nNet change in these two: +$366 million\n\nAnd change in operating lease assets: -$96 million\n\nBut the question says \"change in operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities\" - so it's two separate changes.\n\nSince the instruction says \"the final answer,\" and it's a single number, I think I must have misinterpreted.\n\nLet me search for \"operating portion of long-term assets\" in the financial statements. The balance sheet has \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" under \"OTHER ASSETS,\" so that's likely what they mean.\n\nFor \"net long-term liabilities,\" in the balance sheet, \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" is $5,794, and \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" is $2,375, so total long-term liabilities related to operations is $8,169.\n\nBut \"net\" might mean after subtracting the operating lease assets, so net long-term liabilities = long-term debt + long-term operating lease liabilities - operating lease right-of-use assets.\n\n2024: $5,794 + $2,375 - $2,617 = $5,552\n2023: $5,377 + $2,426 - $2,713 = $5,090\nChange: $5,552 - $5,090 = +$462 million\n\nThis is a possible interpretation of \"net long-term liabilities\" as the net of liabilities and the related assets.\n\nIn some contexts, \"net long-term liabilities\" might mean the net amount after offsetting related assets.\n\nSo the change would be +$462 million.\n\nLet's verify the calculation:\n2024:\nLong-term debt: 5,794\nLong-term operating lease liabilities: 2,375\nOperating lease right-of-use assets: 2,617\nNet = 5,794 + 2,375 - 2,617 = 5,552\n\n2023:\nLong-term debt: 5,377\nLong-term operating lease liabilities: 2,426\nOperating lease right-of-use assets: 2,713\nNet = 5,377 + 2,426 - 2,713 = 5,090\n\nChange: 5,552 - 5,090 = 462\n\nSo the change is +$462 million.\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nI think this is the intended interpretation. \"Net long-term liabilities\" means the net of long-term liabilities and the related operating lease assets.\n\nSo the answer should be +$462 million.\n\nLet me double-check the numbers:\n2024:\n5,794 + 2,375 = 8,169\n8,169 - 2,617 = 5,552\n\n2023:\n5,377 + 2,426 = 7,803\n7,803 - 2,713 = 5,090\n\n5,552 - 5,090 = 462\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the change in \"net long-term liabilities\" (interpreted as long-term liabilities minus operating lease assets) is +$462 million.\n\nThe question says \"change in operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities\" - but if \"net long-term liabilities\" is defined as above, then the \"operating portion of long-term assets\" is already included in the calculation, so the question might be poorly phrased, and they just want the change in net long-term liabilities as defined.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is +$462 million.\n\nI'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe question asks for the change in the \"operating portion of long-term assets\" and \"net long-term liabilities\" from 2023 to 2024. \n\n- The \"operating portion of long-term assets\" refers to operating lease right-of-use assets, which decreased from $2,713 million in 2023 to $2,617 million in 2024, a change of -$96 million.\n- \"Net long-term liabilities\" is interpreted as the net of long-term debt (excluding current portion) and long-term operating lease liabilities, minus operating lease right-of-use assets (to reflect net liabilities after offsetting related assets).\n\nCalculations:\n- 2024 net long-term liabilities = $5,794 (long-term debt) + $2,375 (long-term operating lease liabilities) - $2,617 (operating lease assets) = $5,552 million\n- 2023 net long-term liabilities = $5,377 + $2,426 - $2,713 = $5,090 million\n- Change = $5,552 - $5,090 = +$462 million\n\nThe question's phrasing suggests a single answer, and the calculation for \"net long-term liabilities\" (after offsetting related assets) yields a change of +$462 million.\n\n<answer>:462",

The question is asking for \"the portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for in 2024, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"not accounted for\" means here. In financial statements, sometimes there are items that are not explicitly listed but might be implied or need to be calculated. But looking at the provided financial statements, I should check the balance sheet for \"other long-term assets\" and \"other long-term liabilities.\"\n\nFrom the Consolidated Balance Sheets (September 1, 2024):\n\n- Other long-term assets: $3,936 million\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576 million\n\nWait, but the question mentions \"the portion... not accounted for.\" Hmm. Maybe \"not accounted for\" refers to something else. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says: \"the portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for in 2024, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for.\"\n\nWait, \"not accounted for\" might be a misdirection. Maybe it's asking for the difference between other long-term assets and other long-term liabilities? But that doesn't make sense because they are separate line items.\n\nWait, looking at the balance sheet, \"other long-term assets\" is $3,936 million, and \"other long-term liabilities\" is $2,576 million. But the question says \"the portion... not accounted for.\" Maybe \"not accounted for\" refers to something else in the notes?\n\nWait, looking at Note 5 on Leases, it mentions \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" and \"Operating lease liabilities.\" But the question is about \"other long-term assets\" and \"other long-term operating liabilities.\"\n\nWait, the balance sheet lists \"Other long-term assets\" as $3,936 million. The \"Other long-term liabilities\" are $2,576 million. But the question is asking for \"the portion... not accounted for.\" Maybe \"not accounted for\" is a red herring, and it's simply asking for the difference between these two line items?\n\nWait, but the question says \"net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for.\" Wait, \"other long-term operating liabilities\" might refer to the operating lease liabilities. Let me check.\n\nIn Note 5, under \"Liabilities,\" it says:\n\n- Operating lease liabilities: $2,375 million (long-term)\n- Finance lease liabilities: $1,351 million (long-term)\n\nBut the balance sheet lists \"Other long-term liabilities\" as $2,576 million. Wait, the balance sheet's \"Other long-term liabilities\" is $2,576 million. Let's see what's included there.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n\n\"Other long-term liabilities\" is $2,576 million (2024). The notes might explain what's included here. In Note 5, it says \"Other long-term liabilities\" are part of the total liabilities. Wait, the balance sheet lists:\n\n\"Other long-term liabilities\" as $2,576 million. But in Note 5, the \"Operating lease liabilities\" are $2,375 million (long-term), and \"Finance lease liabilities\" are $1,351 million (long-term). Wait, but the balance sheet's \"Other long-term liabilities\" is $2,576 million, which might include other items besides leases.\n\nWait, the balance sheet's \"Other long-term liabilities\" is $2,576 million. The \"Operating lease liabilities\" (long-term) are $2,375 million, and \"Finance lease liabilities\" (long-term) are $1,351 million. But $2,375 + $1,351 = $3,726 million, which is more than $2,576 million. So maybe the \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the balance sheet includes other items besides lease liabilities.\n\nWait, the balance sheet lists:\n\n\"Other long-term liabilities\" as $2,576 million. The notes might clarify. In Note 5, it says:\n\n\"Other long-term liabilities\" in the balance sheet includes items like deferred tax liabilities, etc. Wait, but the question is about \"other long-term operating liabilities,\" which might refer to the operating lease liabilities.\n\nWait, the question says \"other long-term operating liabilities,\" which probably refers to the operating lease liabilities. So \"other long-term operating liabilities\" would be the operating lease liabilities, which are $2,375 million (long-term portion).\n\nBut the question is asking for \"the portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for\" minus \"the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for.\"\n\nWait, maybe \"not accounted for\" is a mistake, and it's supposed to be \"the amount of other long-term assets minus the amount of other long-term operating liabilities.\"\n\nBut let's check the numbers.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n- Other long-term assets: $3,936 million\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576 million\n\nBut the question specifies \"other long-term operating liabilities,\" which might be a subset. In the balance sheet, \"Other long-term liabilities\" is $2,576 million. But in Note 5, the operating lease liabilities (long-term) are $2,375 million. So perhaps \"other long-term operating liabilities\" refers to the $2,375 million.\n\nWait, the question says \"other long-term operating liabilities,\" so \"operating\" here refers to operating leases. So the operating lease liabilities (long-term) are $2,375 million.\n\nBut the balance sheet lists \"Other long-term liabilities\" as $2,576 million. So maybe \"other long-term operating liabilities\" is part of that $2,576 million. But the question is phrased as \"the portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for\" — but \"not accounted for\" is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe \"not accounted for\" is a typo or misphrase, and it's supposed to be \"the amount of other long-term assets\" minus \"the amount of other long-term operating liabilities.\"\n\nSo, other long-term assets: $3,936 million\n\nOther long-term operating liabilities: $2,375 million (operating lease liabilities, long-term)\n\nSo the difference would be $3,936 - $2,375 = $1,561 million.\n\nBut let's confirm. The question says \"net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for.\" Wait, \"net of\" usually means subtract. So if it's \"the portion of other long-term assets not accounted for\" minus \"the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for,\" but that still doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"not accounted for\" refers to something else. Wait, looking at the balance sheet, \"Other long-term assets\" is $3,936 million. What's included in that? The balance sheet lists:\n\n- Property and equipment, net: $29,032 million\n- Operating lease right-of-use assets: $2,617 million\n- Other long-term assets: $3,936 million\n\nSo \"Other long-term assets\" is a separate line. Similarly, \"Other long-term liabilities\" is $2,576 million.\n\nBut the question mentions \"other long-term operating liabilities,\" which might be the operating lease liabilities. In Note 5, the operating lease liabilities (long-term) are $2,375 million.\n\nSo perhaps the question is asking for (Other long-term assets) minus (Operating lease liabilities, long-term).\n\nSo $3,936 - $2,375 = $1,561 million.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other \"other long-term operating liabilities.\" The balance sheet lists \"Other long-term liabilities\" as $2,576 million, which includes operating lease liabilities. Wait, in the balance sheet, \"Other long-term liabilities\" is $2,576 million. In Note 5, the operating lease liabilities (long-term) are $2,375 million, and finance lease liabilities are $1,351 million. But the balance sheet's \"Other long-term liabilities\" is $2,576 million, which might include both operating and finance lease liabilities, but $2,375 + $1,351 = $3,726, which is more than $2,576. So that doesn't add up. Maybe the \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the balance sheet is a different line.\n\nWait, looking at the balance sheet:\n\n\"Other long-term liabilities\" is $2,576 million. The notes might explain. In Note 5, it says:\n\n\"Other long-term liabilities\" in the balance sheet includes items like deferred tax liabilities, etc. Wait, but the balance sheet lists:\n\n\"Other long-term liabilities\" as $2,576 million. The notes might say that this includes operating lease liabilities, but the operating lease liabilities are listed under \"Operating lease liabilities\" in the notes.\n\nWait, the balance sheet lists:\n\n\"Other long-term liabilities\" as $2,576 million. The notes say:\n\n\"Other long-term liabilities\" in the balance sheet includes the operating lease liabilities and finance lease liabilities. Wait, but the operating lease liabilities (long-term) are $2,375 million, and finance lease liabilities (long-term) are $1,351 million. But $2,375 + $1,351 = $3,726 million, which is more than $2,576 million. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe the \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the balance sheet is a different line. Let's check the balance sheet again.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n\"Other long-term liabilities\" is $2,576 million (2024). The \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" is $5,794 million. \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" is $2,375 million (from Note 5), and \"Long-term finance lease liabilities\" is $1,351 million (from Note 5). Wait, but the balance sheet lists \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" as $2,375 million under \"Other liabilities,\" and \"Long-term finance lease liabilities\" as $1,351 million. Wait, no, the balance sheet lists:\n\n\"Other liabilities\" as:\n\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794 million\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375 million\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576 million\n\nWait, no, the balance sheet says:\n\n\"Other liabilities\" includes:\n\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576\n\nWait, no, the balance sheet lists:\n\n\"Other liabilities\" as:\n\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576\n\nWait, no, the balance sheet says:\n\n\"Other liabilities\" (total) is $2,375 + $2,576 = $4,951 million? Wait, no, the balance sheet lists:\n\n\"Other liabilities\" as:\n\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576\n\nWait, no, the balance sheet lists:\n\n\"Other liabilities\" as a category, and then lists:\n\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576\n\nWait, no, the balance sheet says:\n\n\"Other liabilities\" (which is a line item) is:\n\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576\n\nWait, no, the balance sheet lists \"Other liabilities\" as a total, but the line items under it are:\n\n- Long-term debt, excluding current portion: $5,794\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576\n\nWait, but that would make \"Other liabilities\" = $5,794 + $2,375 + $2,576 = $10,745 million, but the balance sheet says \"Total liabilities\" is $46,209 million. Let's check:\n\nCurrent liabilities: $35,464 million\n\nOther liabilities: $46,209 - $35,464 = $10,745 million. Yes, so \"Other liabilities\" is $10,745 million, which is broken down into:\n\n- Long-term debt: $5,794\n- Long-term operating lease liabilities: $2,375\n- Other long-term liabilities: $2,576\n\nSo \"Other long-term liabilities\" on the balance sheet is $2,576 million, which is separate from the operating lease liabilities.\n\nBut the question says \"other long-term operating liabilities,\" which would refer to the \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" of $2,375 million.\n\nSo the question is asking for:\n\nPortion of other long-term assets (which is $3,936 million) minus portion of other long-term operating liabilities (which is $2,375 million).\n\nSo $3,936 - $2,375 = $1,561 million.\n\nBut the question says \"the portion... not accounted for.\" Maybe \"not accounted for\" is a mistake, and it's supposed to be \"the amount of.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"not accounted for\" refers to something else. For example, in the balance sheet, \"Other long-term assets\" might include items that are not explicitly listed, but the number is given as $3,936 million. Similarly, \"other long-term operating liabilities\" would be the operating lease liabilities of $2,375 million.\n\nSo the calculation is $3,936 - $2,375 = $1,561 million.\n\nLet me check if there's any other possible interpretation. The question says \"net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for.\" Wait, \"net of\" usually means subtract, so it's (other long-term assets) - (other long-term operating liabilities).\n\nYes, so $3,936 - $2,375 = $1,561 million.\n\nI think that's it. The key is to identify the correct line items from the balance sheet and the notes.\n</think>\n\nThe question asks for the portion of other long-term assets not accounted for in 2024, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for. From the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 1, 2024:\n\n- **Other long-term assets**: $3,936 million  \n- **Other long-term operating liabilities** (referring to long-term operating lease liabilities from Note 5): $2,375 million  \n\nThe calculation is:  \n$3,936 million - $2,375 million = $1,561 million  \n\n<answer>:1561",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking about measuring the change between 2023 and 2024 for a specific operating metric after separating other long-term assets and netting long-term liabilities. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what \"that number\" refers to. The original question mentions \"net of long-term liabilities to find what portion of that number is unaccounted for.\" Hmm, maybe it's referring to equity or something else. Wait, looking at the balance sheet, total assets minus current liabilities and other assets might relate to long-term assets net of liabilities.\n\nWait, the key phrase is \"separating other long-term assets, net of long-term liabilities.\" So perhaps they want the net long-term assets after removing other long-term assets. Let me check the balance sheet.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n- Other assets include Property and equipment, net ($29,032 in 2024), Operating lease right-of-use assets ($2,617), and Other long-term assets ($3,936). Wait, but the question says \"separating other long-term assets,\" so maybe they want to exclude those from the total.\n\nWait, the question says \"net of long-term liabilities.\" So total long-term assets minus long-term liabilities. Let's see.\n\nTotal assets in 2024: $69,831\nCurrent liabilities: $35,464\nTotal liabilities: $46,209 (which includes current and long-term)\nLong-term liabilities: Total liabilities minus current liabilities = $46,209 - $35,464 = $10,745. Wait, but looking at the balance sheet, other liabilities include Long-term debt ($5,794), Long-term operating lease liabilities ($2,375), and Other long-term liabilities ($2,576). So total long-term liabilities = 5,794 + 2,375 + 2,576 = $10,745. That matches.\n\nNow, total assets are $69,831. But the question says \"separating other long-term assets.\" Wait, maybe they want to exclude certain assets. The problem states \"after separating other long-term assets,\" so perhaps the \"other long-term assets\" are part of the assets, and we need to net them against long-term liabilities.\n\nWait, the question is a bit confusing. Let's parse it again: \"After separating other long-term assets, net of long-term liabilities to find what portion of that number is unaccounted for...\"\n\nWait, maybe \"other long-term assets\" refers to the \"Other long-term assets\" line item on the balance sheet. In the balance sheet, under \"OTHER ASSETS,\" there's Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. So \"other long-term assets\" might be the $3,936 in 2024 and $3,718 in 2023.\n\nBut the question says \"separating other long-term assets, net of long-term liabilities.\" So perhaps they want to take the \"Other long-term assets\" and subtract long-term liabilities? But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe \"net of long-term liabilities\" means total long-term assets minus long-term liabilities.\n\nWait, let's look at the equity section. Total equity is $23,622 in 2024 and $25,058 in 2023. But the question is about an operating metric, so probably not equity.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"operating metric,\" so maybe it's related to operating income or something else. But the context given is financial statements, so likely a balance sheet item.\n\nWait, the user says \"net of long-term liabilities to find what portion of that number is unaccounted for.\" So perhaps they want to calculate (Total long-term assets - Long-term liabilities) and see the change from 2023 to 2024.\n\nLet's compute Total long-term assets. From the balance sheet:\n\nTotal assets = $69,831 (2024)\nCurrent assets = $34,246\nSo long-term assets = Total assets - Current assets = 69,831 - 34,246 = $35,585.\n\nBut the balance sheet lists \"OTHER ASSETS\" as $29,032 (property) + $2,617 (operating lease) + $3,936 (other long-term) = $35,585. Yes, that's correct.\n\nLong-term liabilities: as calculated before, $10,745 (5,794 + 2,375 + 2,576).\n\nSo net long-term assets (long-term assets minus long-term liabilities) would be 35,585 - 10,745 = $24,840 in 2024.\n\nWait, but the question says \"separating other long-term assets.\" Maybe \"other long-term assets\" refers to the \"Other long-term assets\" line item ($3,936), so they want to exclude that from the calculation. Let's see.\n\nIf we separate \"other long-term assets,\" then long-term assets excluding that would be Property and equipment + Operating lease assets = 29,032 + 2,617 = $31,649 in 2024.\n\nThen net of long-term liabilities: 31,649 - 10,745 = $20,904.\n\nBut the question says \"what portion of that number is unaccounted for.\" Hmm, maybe \"unaccounted for\" refers to something else. Wait, perhaps the \"other long-term assets\" are being subtracted, and then net of long-term liabilities, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the \"Other long-term assets\" line, and they want to see the change in that line after netting with long-term liabilities. But that seems odd.\n\nWait, looking back at the original question: \"After separating other long-term assets, net of long-term liabilities to find what portion of that number is unaccounted for...\"\n\nWait, maybe \"separating other long-term assets\" means removing them from the assets, so total assets minus other long-term assets, then net of long-term liabilities. So:\n\nTotal assets - Other long-term assets = 69,831 - 3,936 = 65,895 (2024)\nThen net of long-term liabilities: 65,895 - 10,745 = 55,150.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch. Alternatively, maybe \"net of long-term liabilities\" means subtracting long-term liabilities from the assets, but the question is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"operating metric\" they're referring to is the equity, but equity is total assets minus total liabilities. Let's check:\n\nTotal liabilities in 2024: $46,209\nTotal assets: $69,831\nEquity: 69,831 - 46,209 = $23,622, which matches the balance sheet.\n\nBut the question says \"net of long-term liabilities,\" not total liabilities. So maybe it's total assets minus current liabilities minus long-term liabilities? But that would be equity, which is already given.\n\nWait, the problem states \"net of long-term liabilities,\" so perhaps it's (Total assets - Current assets) - Long-term liabilities = Long-term assets - Long-term liabilities.\n\nWhich is what I calculated earlier: $35,585 - $10,745 = $24,840 in 2024.\n\nFor 2023:\nTotal assets: $68,994\nCurrent assets: $35,879\nLong-term assets: 68,994 - 35,879 = $33,115\nLong-term liabilities: 5,377 (long-term debt) + 2,426 (operating lease) + 2,550 (other) = $10,353\nNet long-term assets: 33,115 - 10,353 = $22,762\n\nSo the change from 2023 to 2024 would be 24,840 - 22,762 = $2,078.\n\nBut the question asks for \"the change between 2023 and 2024 for that operating metric.\" So the answer would be $2,078 million.\n\nWait, but let's verify the numbers again.\n\n2024:\nLong-term assets: Property and equipment net ($29,032) + Operating lease right-of-use assets ($2,617) + Other long-term assets ($3,936) = 29,032 + 2,617 = 31,649 + 3,936 = 35,585. Correct.\n\nLong-term liabilities: Long-term debt ($5,794) + Long-term operating lease liabilities ($2,375) + Other long-term liabilities ($2,576) = 5,794 + 2,375 = 8,169 + 2,576 = 10,745. Correct.\n\nNet long-term assets: 35,585 - 10,745 = 24,840.\n\n2023:\nLong-term assets: 26,684 (property) + 2,713 (operating lease) + 3,718 (other) = 26,684 + 2,713 = 29,397 + 3,718 = 33,115.\n\nLong-term liabilities: 5,377 + 2,426 + 2,550 = 10,353.\n\nNet long-term assets: 33,115 - 10,353 = 22,762.\n\nChange: 24,840 - 22,762 = 2,078.\n\nSo the change is $2,078 million.\n\nBut the question says \"what portion of that number is unaccounted for.\" Wait, maybe I misinterpreted. The phrase \"net of long-term liabilities to find what portion of that number is unaccounted for\" might mean that after subtracting long-term liabilities from the long-term assets, the remaining is the \"unaccounted for\" portion. But the question is asking for the change in that metric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"unaccounted for\" refers to something else, but given the context, the metric is likely the net long-term assets (long-term assets minus long-term liabilities), and the change between 2023 and 2024 is $2,078 million.\n\nLet me check if there's another possible metric. For example, maybe they want the change in \"Other long-term assets\" net of long-term liabilities. But \"Other long-term assets\" is $3,936 in 2024 and $3,718 in 2023. The change there is $218. But the question says \"separating other long-term assets, net of long-term liabilities,\" which might mean subtracting long-term liabilities from other long-term assets, but that would be negative numbers, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"net of long-term liabilities\" refers to the equity, but equity is total assets minus total liabilities, not just long-term.\n\nWait, the problem states \"net of long-term liabilities,\" so it's specifically long-term, not total. So the calculation I did earlier seems correct.\n\nAnother angle: The question mentions \"operating metric,\" which might refer to operating income. But operating income is $9,285 in 2024 and $8,114 in 2023, so the change is $1,171. But the question specifically talks about \"separating other long-term assets, net of long-term liabilities,\" which points to a balance sheet item, not income statement.\n\nSo I think the correct metric is net long-term assets (long-term assets minus long-term liabilities), and the change is $2,078 million.\n\nLet me confirm the numbers once more.\n\n2024:\nLong-term assets: 29,032 + 2,617 + 3,936 = 35,585\nLong-term liabilities: 5,794 + 2,375 + 2,576 = 10,745\nNet: 35,585 - 10,745 = 24,840\n\n2023:\nLong-term assets: 26,684 + 2,713 + 3,718 = 33,115\nLong-term liabilities: 5,377 + 2,426 + 2,550 = 10,353\nNet: 33,115 - 10,353 = 22,762\n\nDifference: 24,840 - 22,762 = 2,078.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the change is $2,078 million.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:2,078",

      "question": "Calculate NOPAT for 2024. Make sure to make adjustments for one-time changes.",
      "ground_truth": "$7,113 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this NOPAT calculation for Costco in 2024. First, I need to recall what NOPAT stands for—Net Operating Profit After Tax. It's calculated as EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) multiplied by (1 - tax rate), but sometimes adjustments are needed for one-time items.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, the key line items are in the income statement. The \"Income Before Income Taxes\" is $9,740 million for 2024. But NOPAT typically starts from operating income, not income before taxes. Wait, operating income is $9,285 million. However, NOPAT is usually calculated from operating income adjusted for taxes, but sometimes it's based on EBIT.\n\nWait, let me clarify: NOPAT = EBIT × (1 - tax rate). But EBIT is the same as operating income here. The operating income is $9,285 million. But the tax rate isn't directly given. The income tax expense is $2,373 million, and income before taxes is $9,740 million. So the tax rate would be 2,373 / 9,740 ≈ 24.36%.\n\nBut NOPAT is often calculated as (Operating Income - Non-operating items) × (1 - tax rate). Wait, but in this case, the operating income is already after operating expenses, so maybe NOPAT is just operating income minus taxes? Wait, no. NOPAT is EBIT × (1 - tax rate). So EBIT is operating income here, which is $9,285 million. Then NOPAT = 9,285 × (1 - 0.2436) ≈ 9,285 × 0.7564 ≈ $7,028 million. But let me check if there are any one-time adjustments needed.\n\nThe problem mentions \"adjustments for one-time changes.\" Looking at the notes, there's a note about a special dividend and stock-based compensation. Wait, the stock-based compensation is part of operating expenses. The income statement shows \"Selling, general and administrative\" as $22,810 million, which includes stock-based compensation. But the note says stock-based compensation expense is $818 million for 2024. However, NOPAT adjustments usually don't include non-cash items like stock-based comp because it's already in operating income. Wait, but NOPAT is after tax, so maybe we need to adjust for non-operating items.\n\nWait, another angle: sometimes NOPAT is calculated as Net Income + Interest Expense (net of tax) + Non-operating items. But the standard formula is NOPAT = EBIT × (1 - tax rate). Let's confirm the numbers.\n\nOperating income (EBIT) = $9,285 million.\n\nIncome tax expense = $2,373 million.\n\nSo NOPAT = EBIT - Tax Expense = 9,285 - 2,373 = $6,912 million. Wait, but that's not right because EBIT is before tax, so NOPAT should be EBIT × (1 - tax rate). But tax rate is tax expense / income before tax = 2,373 / 9,740 ≈ 24.36%. So NOPAT = 9,285 × (1 - 0.2436) = 9,285 × 0.7564 ≈ 6,912 million. Alternatively, NOPAT = EBIT - Tax Expense = 9,285 - 2,373 = 6,912 million. Wait, that's the same as EBIT minus tax expense. But EBIT is before tax, so EBIT - tax expense = NOPAT. Yes, that's correct. So NOPAT = Operating Income - Income Tax Expense = 9,285 - 2,373 = $6,912 million.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"adjustments for one-time changes.\" Are there any one-time items in the income statement that need to be adjusted? Let's check the income statement. The \"Other Income (Expense)\" includes interest expense and interest income. But NOPAT is based on operating income, so interest is excluded. The operating income is already after operating expenses, so it's EBIT. So the tax expense related to operating income is the tax expense provided. Wait, but the tax expense is for the entire income before tax, which includes non-operating items. However, for NOPAT, we usually consider the tax on operating income. But in practice, NOPAT is often calculated as EBIT × (1 - tax rate), where tax rate is the effective tax rate. But the effective tax rate is 24.36%, so 9,285 × (1 - 0.2436) = 6,912.\n\nBut let's check if there are any one-time items. Looking at the notes, there's a mention of a special dividend and stock-based compensation. The stock-based compensation is part of operating expenses, so it's already included in operating income. The special dividend is related to equity, not affecting operating income. The note about the special dividend says it didn't result in additional stock-based compensation expense. So no adjustment needed for one-time items in the operating income.\n\nWait, the problem says \"adjustments for one-time changes.\" Let me check the income statement for any unusual items. The \"Impairment of assets and other non-cash operating activities, net\" is listed as ($9) million in the cash flow statement, but that's a small amount. The income statement doesn't show any significant one-time charges. The \"Other Income (Expense)\" has interest expense and income, but those are non-operating, so NOPAT should exclude them.\n\nSo, NOPAT = Operating Income - Income Tax Expense = 9,285 - 2,373 = 6,912 million.\n\nWait, but let's confirm with the cash flow statement. The cash flow from operations starts with net income, then adds back depreciation, etc. But NOPAT is a different metric. The standard formula is NOPAT = EBIT × (1 - tax rate). EBIT is operating income, which is $9,285. Tax rate is 2,373 / 9,740 = 24.36%. So NOPAT = 9,285 × (1 - 0.2436) = 9,285 × 0.7564 ≈ 6,912. So that's correct.\n\nBut let's check if the tax expense is correctly applied. The income before taxes is $9,740, which includes interest expense. But NOPAT is based on operating income, so the tax rate should be applied to operating income. However, the tax expense is for the entire income before tax, which includes non-operating items. But for NOPAT, we usually use the tax rate to adjust operating income. So the calculation as EBIT - tax expense is correct because tax expense is the actual tax paid on the income before tax, which includes operating and non-operating. But since NOPAT is after tax on operating income, it's better to use the tax rate. However, in practice, NOPAT is often calculated as EBIT × (1 - tax rate), where tax rate is the effective tax rate.\n\nGiven that the tax rate is 24.36%, and EBIT is 9,285, NOPAT = 9,285 × (1 - 0.2436) = 6,912.\n\nAlternatively, since the tax expense is 2,373, and EBIT is 9,285, then NOPAT = EBIT - tax expense = 9,285 - 2,373 = 6,912. Wait, but EBIT is before tax, so EBIT - tax expense = NOPAT. Yes, that's correct. Because EBIT is the profit before interest and taxes, so after paying taxes, it's NOPAT.\n\nWait, no. EBIT is before interest and taxes. So EBIT - taxes = NOPAT. Yes, that's right. So NOPAT = EBIT - taxes = 9,285 - 2,373 = 6,912.\n\nBut let's check if there are any one-time adjustments. The problem mentions \"adjustments for one-time changes.\" Looking at the income statement, the \"Other Income (Expense)\" has interest expense of ($169) and interest income of $624, but those are non-operating, so they don't affect NOPAT. The operating income is already net of operating expenses.\n\nIn the cash flow statement, there's a line for \"Impairment of assets and other non-cash operating activities, net\" of ($9) million. But that's a small amount and likely already included in operating income. So no adjustment needed.\n\nAnother thing: the note about the special dividend and stock-based compensation. The stock-based compensation is part of operating expenses, so it's already in the operating income. The special dividend is a dividend to shareholders, not affecting the income statement's operating income.\n\nSo, the NOPAT should be $6,912 million.\n\nWait, but let's check the numbers again. Operating income is $9,285 million. Income tax expense is $2,373 million. So NOPAT = 9,285 - 2,373 = 6,912. Yes.\n\nBut I should confirm if the tax expense is correctly attributed. The income before taxes is $9,740, which is operating income plus other income (interest income and expense). Operating income is $9,285, then other income (expense) is $624 - $169 = $455. So 9,285 + 455 = 9,740, which matches. So the tax expense of $2,373 is on the total income before tax, but for NOPAT, we only care about the tax on operating income. However, since the tax rate is applied uniformly, using the effective tax rate is appropriate.\n\nBut in most cases, NOPAT is calculated as EBIT × (1 - tax rate), where tax rate is the effective tax rate. So 9,285 × (1 - 2,373/9,740) = 9,285 × (1 - 0.2436) = 9,285 × 0.7564 = 6,912. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the NOPAT for 2024 is $6,912 million.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax) for 2024, we use the formula:  \n**NOPAT = Operating Income × (1 - Effective Tax Rate)**  \nor equivalently,  \n**NOPAT = Operating Income - Income Tax Expense** (since tax expense is directly attributable to operating income in this context).\n\nFrom the income statement:  \n- Operating Income (EBIT) = $9,285 million  \n- Income Tax Expense = $2,373 million  \n\nNOPAT = $9,285 - $2,373 = **$6,912 million**.  \n\nNo one-time adjustments are required, as the income statement does not reflect material non-recurring items affecting operating income (e.g., stock-based compensation is already included in operating expenses, and the special dividend adjustment did not impact operating income).\n\n<answer>:6912",

      "question": "Estimate Variable Lease Assets in 2023",
      "ground_truth": "$1,405 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this problem. The question is to estimate the Variable Lease Assets in 2023 for Costco. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Variable Lease Assets refer to. From the context provided, lease assets are typically categorized into operating and finance leases. The problem mentions \"Variable Lease Assets,\" but in the financial statements, I don't see a specific line item called \"Variable Lease Assets.\" Instead, there's \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" and \"Finance lease assets.\"\n\nLooking at the Consolidated Balance Sheets, under \"OTHER ASSETS,\" there's a line item \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" which for 2023 (September 3, 2023) is $2,713 million. Then there's \"Finance lease assets\" listed as $1,325 million for 2023. \n\nWait, but the question asks for \"Variable Lease Assets.\" Hmm. In lease accounting, variable lease payments are typically not included in the right-of-use asset. The right-of-use asset is based on the present value of fixed lease payments. Variable lease payments, like those based on sales volume or inflation, are expensed as incurred and don't affect the asset value. \n\nSo, the \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" and \"Finance lease assets\" are the fixed components. The variable parts are excluded from the asset calculation. Therefore, the Variable Lease Assets would be zero because variable payments don't get capitalized into the asset. \n\nBut let me double-check the notes. In Note 5—Leases, it says \"Operating lease costs\" include \"Variable lease costs (1) $163 $160 $157\" for 2024, 2023, 2022. The note also states: \"The components of lease expense, excluding short-term lease costs and sublease income (which were immaterial), were as follows.\" So variable lease costs are part of the expense, not the asset. \n\nThe right-of-use assets are calculated based on fixed lease payments. The variable components are expensed as incurred. Therefore, there's no \"Variable Lease Asset\" on the balance sheet. The question might be a trick to see if I confuse variable lease costs (expense) with variable lease assets (which don't exist). \n\nSo, the answer should be zero. But let me check if there's any mention of variable lease assets in the notes. The balance sheet shows \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" and \"Finance lease assets,\" but no variable component. The variable lease costs are in the income statement, not the balance sheet. \n\nTherefore, the Variable Lease Assets in 2023 would be $0. But wait, the problem says \"estimate,\" so maybe they want the variable lease costs? But the question specifically says \"Assets,\" not expenses. Assets are on the balance sheet, so variable lease costs are expenses, not assets. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes \"variable\" might refer to something else, but in lease accounting, variable lease payments are not part of the asset. The right-of-use asset is for fixed payments. So the answer is zero. \n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, the operating lease right-of-use assets for 2023 are $2,713 million. But that's the total right-of-use asset, which includes both fixed and variable? Wait, no. Under ASC 842, the right-of-use asset is based on the present value of lease payments, which includes fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate (like inflation), but not variable payments based on sales or usage. \n\nWait, the note says: \"Operating lease costs (1) $284 $309 $297\" and \"Variable lease costs (1) $163 $160 $157.\" So the variable lease costs are part of the operating lease costs. But the right-of-use asset is based on the fixed lease payments. The variable lease costs are expensed as incurred, so they don't affect the asset. \n\nTherefore, the Variable Lease Assets would be zero because variable lease payments don't get capitalized. The asset is for fixed payments. So the answer is $0. \n\nBut let me confirm with the numbers. The operating lease right-of-use assets are $2,713 million in 2023. The variable lease costs are $160 million in 2023 (from the note: \"Variable lease costs (1) $163 $160 $157\" for 2024, 2023, 2022). So the variable costs are $160 million, but that's an expense, not an asset. \n\nSo the question is asking for \"Variable Lease Assets,\" which don't exist. Therefore, the estimate is $0. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is misphrased, and they actually want the operating lease right-of-use assets. But the question specifically says \"Variable Lease Assets.\" Given that, the answer should be zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"variable\" here refers to something else, but in standard financial terms, variable lease payments don't form part of the asset. So I think the answer is $0.\n</think>\n\nThe question asks for \"Variable Lease Assets\" in 2023. Under lease accounting standards (ASC 842), variable lease payments (e.g., based on sales volume or inflation indices) are expensed as incurred and do not form part of the right-of-use asset. The balance sheet reports \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" ($2,713 million as of September 3, 2023) and \"Finance lease assets\" ($1,325 million), which reflect fixed lease payments only. Variable lease costs are disclosed in the income statement (e.g., $160 million for 2023 in Note 5), but these are expenses, not assets. There is no line item for \"Variable Lease Assets\" on the balance sheet, as variable payments are not capitalized.\n\n<answer>:0",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is to estimate the Variable Lease Assets in 2024 for Costco. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Variable Lease Assets are. From the context provided, lease assets are typically categorized into operating and finance leases. The problem mentions \"Variable Lease Assets,\" but in the financial statements, I don't see a specific line item called \"Variable Lease Assets.\" Instead, there's \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" and \"Finance lease assets.\"\n\nLooking at the Consolidated Balance Sheets, under \"OTHER ASSETS,\" there's \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" listed as $2,617 million as of September 1, 2024. Then there's \"Finance lease assets\" of $1,433 million. The total lease assets are $4,050 million, which is the sum of both.\n\nBut the question asks for \"Variable Lease Assets.\" Wait, maybe \"Variable\" here refers to the operating lease assets, as operating leases often have variable components (like variable lease payments based on usage), whereas finance leases are more fixed. However, in the notes, the operating lease right-of-use assets are presented as a single figure, not broken down into variable and fixed.\n\nWait, the problem might be using \"Variable Lease Assets\" to mean the operating lease assets, since operating leases can have variable payments. But the term \"Variable Lease Assets\" isn't standard. Typically, lease assets are reported as right-of-use assets, which include both fixed and variable components. However, in the financial statements provided, the operating lease right-of-use assets are given as a total figure.\n\nLooking at Note 5—Leases, the table shows \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" as $2,617 million for 2024. The finance lease assets are separate. The question says \"Variable Lease Assets,\" but in the context of the financial statements, the operating lease assets are the ones that might have variable components. However, the term \"variable\" might be a misnomer here, or perhaps it's referring to the operating lease assets.\n\nWait, the problem might be confusing \"variable\" with \"operating.\" In lease accounting, operating leases are often considered to have variable payments, whereas finance leases are more like loans with fixed payments. So the operating lease right-of-use assets would be the variable lease assets.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, the operating lease right-of-use assets are $2,617 million as of September 1, 2024. The question is asking for the estimate for 2024, which is exactly the figure provided in the balance sheet. So the answer should be $2,617 million.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"estimate,\" but the balance sheet already shows the exact figure. Maybe they want the number as presented. Let me check the balance sheet again.\n\nIn the Consolidated Balance Sheets, under \"OTHER ASSETS,\" it's listed as \"Operating lease right-of-use assets $2,617\" for 2024. So the answer is $2,617 million.\n\nBut the question says \"Variable Lease Assets,\" not \"Operating Lease Assets.\" However, in the context of the provided financial statements, the only lease assets mentioned are operating and finance. Since operating leases are typically the ones with variable payments (though the right-of-use asset is a fixed amount based on present value), the term \"variable\" might be a red herring, or perhaps it's a mistake in the question. But given the data, the operating lease right-of-use assets are the closest match.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes \"variable lease payments\" refer to the lease costs that vary, but the asset itself is the right-of-use asset, which is a fixed amount. So the asset is not variable; the payments might be. But the question asks for \"Variable Lease Assets,\" which might be a misstatement. Given the options, the operating lease right-of-use assets are the only ones that could be considered, as finance leases are fixed.\n\nSo the answer should be $2,617 million.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:2,617",

      "ground_truth": "$97 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking for the change in variable lease assets from 2023 to 2024. \n\nFirst, I need to find where lease assets are reported in the financial statements. Looking at the provided context, there's a section on leases in Note 5. The Consolidated Balance Sheets also list \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" under Other Assets.\n\nChecking the Balance Sheets:\n- For September 1, 2024 (2024): Operating lease right-of-use assets are $2,617 million.\n- For September 3, 2023 (2023): Operating lease right-of-use assets are $2,713 million.\n\nWait, the question mentions \"variable lease assets,\" but the balance sheet shows \"Operating lease right-of-use assets.\" I think that's what they're referring to. The term \"variable\" might be a bit confusing here, but in lease accounting, right-of-use assets are typically fixed, but maybe the question is using \"variable\" incorrectly. However, the data provided is for operating lease right-of-use assets.\n\nSo, the change would be 2024 amount minus 2023 amount: $2,617 - $2,713 = -$96 million. That means a decrease of $96 million.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says \"variable lease assets,\" but in the context, the lease assets are listed as \"Operating lease right-of-use assets.\" There's no mention of \"variable\" in the notes. Maybe it's a typo or misnomer. The standard term is right-of-use assets for operating leases. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nLooking at Note 5, it also shows \"Finance lease assets\" but the question is about lease assets in general. However, the balance sheet lists \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" as $2,617 and $2,713. The finance lease assets are separate, but the question probably refers to the operating lease assets since they're the main ones.\n\nSo the change is 2,617 - 2,713 = -96. So a decrease of $96 million.\n\nWait, the question says \"change,\" which could be absolute value, but usually, it's the difference. So the answer should be a decrease of $96 million, or -$96 million. But in financial terms, they might want the absolute change, but the question says \"change,\" so it's likely the difference.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"Estimate the change in variable lease assets from 2023 to 2024.\" So from 2023 to 2024, the asset decreased by $96 million.\n\nConfirming the numbers again:\n- 2024: $2,617 million\n- 2023: $2,713 million\n- Difference: 2,617 - 2,713 = -96\n\nSo the change is -$96 million, or a decrease of $96 million.\n\nThe answer should be in the correct financial format. Probably as a negative number or stating the decrease. But the problem says \"change,\" so the numerical value is -96 million. However, sometimes they want the absolute value, but the question doesn't specify. But in financial contexts, change can be negative.\n\nLooking at the instructions: \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" So likely -$96 million, but written as a number with the unit.\n\nWait, the numbers in the balance sheet are in millions. So the answer should be -96 (in millions), but the problem might expect it as a number with the unit. However, the example in the problem uses \"$2,617\" so probably the answer should be in millions.\n\nSo the change is $-96 million, but typically written as a decrease of $96 million. But the question says \"change,\" so the numerical value is -96.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other lease asset. The balance sheet also lists \"Finance lease assets\" as $1,433 in 2024 and $1,325 in 2023. But the question says \"variable lease assets,\" which might not refer to finance leases. The operating lease right-of-use assets are the main ones, and the term \"variable\" might be a mistake. The operating lease assets are typically the ones that are variable in some contexts, but I think it's safe to go with the operating lease right-of-use assets.\n\nSo the answer is a decrease of $96 million, so the change is -$96 million.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"variable lease assets,\" but in the notes, it's \"Operating lease right-of-use assets.\" Maybe \"variable\" refers to the fact that lease payments can be variable, but the asset itself is fixed. However, the balance sheet lists the right-of-use asset, which is the asset, not the liability. So I think the question is using \"variable\" incorrectly, and they mean the operating lease assets.\n\nTherefore, the change is 2,617 - 2,713 = -96 million.\n\nSo the final answer should be -96 million, but in the required format. The problem says \"in the correct financial format,\" so probably as a number with the unit. But the example in the context uses \"$2,617\" so maybe the answer should be \"$-96 million\" but the instructions say \"concise,\" so likely just -96.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" Looking at the context, the numbers are presented as \"$2,617\" so the answer should probably be in the same style. But since it's a change, it's a difference. So the answer is -$96 million.\n\nBut the instructions say \"exact final answer\" and \"in the correct financial format.\" So perhaps they want it as a number with the unit. However, in the context of the problem, the answer is likely expected to be the numerical difference, so -96 (in millions).\n\nWait, the problem says \"change,\" so the answer is the difference. So from 2023 to 2024, it's 2024 minus 2023: 2,617 - 2,713 = -96. So the change is -96 million.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is -96 million, but written as -96 (since the context uses millions, and the answer should be concise).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"in the correct financial format,\" so maybe they want it as a number with the unit. But the examples in the problem use \"$2,617\" so perhaps the answer should be \"$-96 million\" but the instructions say \"concise,\" so maybe just -96.\n\nLooking at the instructions again: \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" So probably -96 million, but written as -96 (since the context uses millions, and the answer is in millions).\n\nWait, the balance sheet amounts are in millions, so the answer is -96 (million dollars). So the concise answer is -96.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other data. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows mention \"Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for new or modified leases\" but that's not relevant for the balance sheet change.\n\nAnother check: Note 5 shows \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" as $2,617 and $2,713. So the change is indeed -96.\n\nTherefore, the answer is -96.\n</think>\n\n<answer>-$96</answer>",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is to estimate the Variable Lease Liability in 2024 for Costco. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a lease liability is. From the context provided, lease liabilities are part of the balance sheet. Looking at the Consolidated Balance Sheets, under \"Other Liabilities,\" there's a line for \"Long-term operating lease liabilities\" which is $2,375 million as of September 1, 2024. But the question asks for the \"Variable Lease Liability.\" Wait, lease liabilities can be fixed or variable. \n\nWait, the problem mentions \"Variable Lease Liability.\" In lease accounting, variable lease payments are typically not included in the lease liability. The lease liability is based on fixed payments. However, the question might be referring to the current portion of the lease liability. \n\nLooking at the balance sheet, under \"Current Liabilities,\" there's \"Operating lease liabilities\" of $179 million. The long-term portion is $2,375 million. But the question says \"Variable Lease Liability.\" Hmm. Wait, maybe \"variable\" here is a misnomer, or perhaps it's referring to the current portion. \n\nWait, the problem might be confusing \"variable\" with \"current.\" Let me check the notes. In Note 5—Leases, the table shows \"Operating lease liabilities\" as $179 million current and $2,375 million long-term. The total lease liability would be the sum of current and long-term. But the question says \"Variable Lease Liability,\" which might be a typo or misstatement. \n\nWait, in lease accounting, variable lease payments (like those based on sales volume) are expensed as incurred and not part of the lease liability. The lease liability is for fixed payments. So the \"Variable Lease Liability\" might not be a standard term. But the problem is asking for it, so perhaps they mean the current portion of the lease liability. \n\nLooking at the balance sheet, the current portion of operating lease liabilities is $179 million. The long-term is $2,375 million. But the question says \"Variable,\" which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe they want the total lease liability, but that's not variable. \n\nWait, the problem says \"Variable Lease Liability,\" but in the context of the financial statements, lease liabilities are fixed. The variable lease costs are included in the income statement as part of operating expenses. For example, in Note 5, it says \"Variable lease costs (1) $163 $160 $157\" which are included in the income statement. So the variable lease costs are expensed as incurred, not part of the liability. \n\nTherefore, the lease liability (both current and long-term) is for fixed payments. The question might have a typo, and they actually want the current portion of the lease liability, which is $179 million. But let's check the exact numbers. \n\nIn the Consolidated Balance Sheets, under Current Liabilities: \"Operating lease liabilities $179\" and under Other Liabilities: \"Long-term operating lease liabilities $2,375.\" So the current portion is $179 million. \n\nThe question says \"Variable Lease Liability,\" but since variable lease payments aren't part of the liability, the only lease liability numbers are the fixed ones. So perhaps the question meant \"Current Lease Liability\" or \"Operating Lease Liability.\" Given that, the current portion is $179 million. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"Variable Lease Liability,\" which might be a mistake. In some contexts, \"variable\" could refer to the current portion, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe they want the total lease liability, but that's $179 + $2,375 = $2,554 million. Wait, in Note 5, there's a table showing \"Present value of lease liabilities $2,554 $1,498\" for operating leases. Wait, looking at the note:\n\n\"As of September 1, 2024, future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\nOperating lease payments have not been reduced by expected future sublease income of $98.\nExcludes $1,080 of lease payments for leases that have been signed but not commenced.\"\n\nThen it shows:\n\n2025 $242\n2026 247\n2027 226\n2028 209\n2029 183\nThereafter 2,205\nTotal 3,312\nLess amount representing interest 758\nPresent value of lease liabilities $2,554\"\n\nSo the present value of lease liabilities is $2,554 million. But the balance sheet shows current portion $179 and long-term $2,375, which sums to $2,554. So the total lease liability is $2,554 million. But the question is about \"Variable Lease Liability,\" which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, the problem might have a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be \"Current Lease Liability\" or \"Operating Lease Liability.\" Given that the current portion is $179 million, but the total is $2,554. However, the question says \"Variable,\" which isn't matching. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"Estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.\" The term \"variable\" might be a red herring, or perhaps it's referring to the variable component. But in lease accounting, variable lease payments are not included in the liability. The liability is for fixed payments. So the variable part is expensed as incurred, not part of the liability. \n\nTherefore, the lease liability (fixed) is $2,554 million total, but the question says \"Variable,\" which might be a mistake. However, the problem might be using \"variable\" incorrectly. Given that, the most likely answer they want is the current portion, which is $179 million. But let's check the balance sheet again.\n\nIn the balance sheet, \"Operating lease liabilities\" under current liabilities is $179 million. The long-term is $2,375 million. So the current portion is $179. If the question meant \"Current Lease Liability,\" then $179 million. But the problem says \"Variable,\" which is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Variable Lease Liability\" refers to the variable lease payments, but those are not a liability. The variable lease costs are $163 million in the income statement (as per Note 5: \"Variable lease costs (1) $163 $160 $157\"). But that's an expense, not a liability. \n\nWait, the question is asking for a liability, so it must be the lease liability. Given that, and the fact that \"variable\" might be a typo, the answer is likely the current portion of the operating lease liability, which is $179 million. \n\nBut let's check the exact numbers. The balance sheet shows:\n\nCurrent Liabilities:\nOperating lease liabilities $179\n\nOther Liabilities:\nLong-term operating lease liabilities $2,375\n\nSo the current portion is $179. The question says \"Variable,\" but maybe it's a mistake for \"Current.\" In some contexts, \"variable\" might be confused with \"current,\" but that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the total lease liability, which is $2,554 million (as per the present value calculation in Note 5). But the balance sheet shows $179 + $2,375 = $2,554, which matches the present value. \n\nBut the question says \"Variable,\" which doesn't align. However, given the options, the most probable intended answer is the current portion, $179 million. But I need to confirm.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Variable Lease Liability,\" but in the context of the financial statements, there's no such line item. The lease liability is fixed. So perhaps the question has a typo, and they meant \"Current Lease Liability.\" In that case, the answer is $179 million.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Variable\" refers to the fact that the lease payments are variable, but that's not how it's accounted for. The liability is for fixed payments. So I think the question has a typo, and the intended answer is the current portion of the operating lease liability, which is $179 million.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet again: \"Operating lease liabilities\" under current liabilities is $179. So the answer should be $179 million. But let's check if there's any other mention of variable lease liability.\n\nIn Note 5, it says \"Variable lease costs (1) $163...\" which is an expense, not a liability. So the liability is fixed. Therefore, the question's \"Variable\" is likely a mistake, and they want the current lease liability. So the answer is $179 million.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:179",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking for the operating cash for 2024. The instructions say that if it's not mentioned, I should assume it's the minimum of 2% of revenue and cash & cash equivalents.\n\nFirst, I need to check if \"operating cash\" is mentioned in the provided financial statements. Looking through the context, there's a section called \"CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\" which includes \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" for 2024. The value listed there is $11,339 million.\n\nWait, the question says \"operating cash,\" but in financial terms, that's usually referred to as \"net cash provided by operating activities.\" The statement clearly shows that number. So I don't need to use the fallback assumption because it's directly provided.\n\nLet me double-check the context. The \"CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\" section under \"52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024\" has \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" as $11,339 million. That's the exact figure they're asking for.\n\nThe fallback rule is only if it's not mentioned. Since it's clearly stated, I should use that number. The problem mentions \"operating cash,\" which might be a shorthand for \"operating cash flow,\" so the $11,339 million is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm there's no other mention. The other sections like income statement and balance sheet don't list \"operating cash\" directly, but the cash flow statement does. So the answer is $11,339 million.\n\nWait, the question says \"operating cash,\" but in the cash flow statement, it's \"net cash provided by operating activities.\" I think that's what they mean. The problem might be using \"operating cash\" as a term for that line item. So the answer is $11,339.\n\nAlso, checking the numbers: the cash flow statement shows $11,339 for 2024. The revenue for 2024 is $254,453 million (total revenue from income statement). If I were to calculate 2% of revenue, that would be 0.02 * 254,453 = $5,089.06 million. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2024 is $9,906 million. The minimum of those two would be $5,089.06 million. But since the actual operating cash flow is provided as $11,339, which is higher than both, the fallback isn't needed. So the answer is $11,339 million.\n\nThe problem says \"if there is no mention, assume it is the minimum...\" but since it's mentioned, we use the actual number. So the final answer is $11,339 million.\n</think>\n\nThe operating cash flow for 2024 is explicitly provided in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" as $11,339 million. Since the value is directly stated in the financial statements, the fallback assumption is not required.\n\n<answer>:11339",

The key here is to identify the cash amount and the revenue for 2024.\n\nLooking at the Consolidated Balance Sheets, under Current Assets, Cash and cash equivalents as of September 1, 2024, is $9,906 million. That's the cash figure.\n\nNext, revenue for 2024. From the Consolidated Statements of Income, Total Revenue for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, is $254,453 million.\n\nThe problem states that operating cash is the minimum between 2% of revenue and cash. So I need to calculate 2% of revenue and compare it to the cash amount.\n\nCalculating 2% of revenue: 2% of $254,453 million = 0.02 * 254,453 = $5,089.06 million.\n\nNow, compare this to the cash amount: $9,906 million. The minimum of $5,089.06 million and $9,906 million is $5,089.06 million.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for \"excess cash.\" Excess cash typically refers to cash beyond what's needed for operations. However, the problem specifies that operating cash is the minimum between 2% of revenue and cash. So excess cash might be the cash minus the operating cash.\n\nWait, let me read the question again: \"What is excess cash in 2024, given that operating cash is calculated as the minimum between taking 2% of revenue and cash.\"\n\nSo operating cash = min(2% of revenue, cash). Then excess cash would be cash - operating cash.\n\nSo cash is $9,906 million. Operating cash is min(2% of 254,453, 9,906) = min(5,089.06, 9,906) = 5,089.06.\n\nTherefore, excess cash = 9,906 - 5,089.06 = $4,816.94 million.\n\nBut let me check if the problem defines excess cash as something else. The problem says \"operating cash is calculated as the minimum between taking 2% of revenue and cash.\" So operating cash is the smaller of the two. Then excess cash would be the cash not used for operating purposes, which is cash minus operating cash.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So excess cash = cash - min(2% revenue, cash).\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nCash = 9,906\n\n2% of revenue = 0.02 * 254,453 = 5,089.06\n\nmin(5,089.06, 9,906) = 5,089.06\n\nExcess cash = 9,906 - 5,089.06 = 4,816.94\n\nRounded to the nearest million, it's $4,817 million. But the problem might expect it in millions as per the financial statements, so $4,817 million.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact numbers. The revenue is $254,453 million. 2% of that is 254,453 * 0.02 = 5,089.06. Cash is 9,906. So min is 5,089.06. Excess cash is 9,906 - 5,089.06 = 4,816.94. So $4,817 million when rounded.\n\nBut the problem says \"excess cash,\" and in financial terms, sometimes excess cash is the amount above a certain threshold. Here, the threshold is 2% of revenue. So yes, the excess would be cash minus that threshold.\n\nAnother way to think: if cash is more than 2% of revenue, then operating cash is 2% of revenue, and excess is the rest. If cash is less than 2% of revenue, then operating cash is cash, and excess is zero. But in this case, cash (9,906) is more than 2% of revenue (5,089), so operating cash is 5,089, excess is 9,906 - 5,089 = 4,817.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be $4,817 million.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the revenue. The Total Revenue is $254,453 million. The problem says \"operating cash is calculated as the minimum between taking 2% of revenue and cash.\" So revenue here is total revenue, which is 254,453.\n\nCalculating 2% of 254,453: 254,453 * 0.02 = 5,089.06.\n\nCash is 9,906.\n\nSo min(5,089.06, 9,906) = 5,089.06.\n\nExcess cash = 9,906 - 5,089.06 = 4,816.94, which rounds to 4,817.\n\nThe financial statements present amounts in millions, so the answer should be in millions, so $4,817 million.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other context I'm missing. The problem mentions \"excess cash,\" but in the context of the given calculation. So based on the problem statement, this should be it.\n\nAnother check: the cash and cash equivalents are $9,906 million as per the balance sheet. Revenue is $254,453 million. 2% of revenue is about $5,089 million. So excess cash is $9,906 - $5,089 = $4,817 million.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe question asks for excess cash in 2024, defined as cash minus the minimum between 2% of revenue and cash. \n\n- Cash and cash equivalents (from balance sheet): $9,906 million  \n- Total revenue (from income statement): $254,453 million  \n- 2% of revenue: $254,453 × 0.02 = $5,089.06 million  \n- Minimum of $5,089.06 million and $9,906 million = $5,089.06 million  \n- Excess cash = $9,906 - $5,089.06 = $4,816.94 million  \n\nRounded to the nearest million, excess cash is $4,817 million.\n\n<answer>:4,817",

      "question": "What is operating current assets in 2024, assuming that 2% of revenue is operating cash?",
      "ground_truth": "$28,191 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this problem. The question is asking for the operating current assets in 2024, assuming that 2% of revenue is operating cash. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what operating current assets typically include. From the balance sheet provided, current assets are listed as:\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $9,906 million\n- Short-term investments: $1,238 million\n- Receivables, net: $2,721 million\n- Merchandise inventories: $18,647 million\n- Other current assets: $1,734 million\n\nBut the question specifies \"operating current assets,\" which usually refers to the assets used in day-to-day operations. In many financial contexts, operating current assets exclude cash and short-term investments because they're not directly tied to operations. However, the problem states to assume that 2% of revenue is operating cash. So I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"2% of revenue is operating cash.\" So operating cash is part of the current assets, but typically cash and cash equivalents are considered non-operating. But here, they're defining operating cash as 2% of revenue. So I need to calculate 2% of total revenue and then see how that fits into the current assets.\n\nLooking at the income statement, total revenue for 2024 is $254,453 million (net sales + membership fees). So 2% of that would be 0.02 * 254,453 = $5,089.06 million. But wait, the problem says \"operating cash,\" so maybe they want to replace the cash and cash equivalents with this 2% figure? Or is operating cash a subset?\n\nWait, the question is asking for \"operating current assets,\" which might mean the current assets used in operations, excluding cash and short-term investments. But the problem specifies that 2% of revenue is operating cash, so perhaps they want us to calculate operating cash as 2% of revenue and then sum that with other operating current assets.\n\nBut let's check standard definitions. Operating current assets typically include receivables, inventories, and other current assets directly related to operations, but exclude cash and short-term investments. However, the problem is defining \"operating cash\" as 2% of revenue, which might be a specific instruction here.\n\nSo, the problem states: \"assuming that 2% of revenue is operating cash.\" So operating cash = 2% of total revenue.\n\nTotal revenue for 2024 is $254,453 million. So 2% of that is 0.02 * 254,453 = $5,089.06 million.\n\nNow, operating current assets would be operating cash plus other operating current assets. But what are the other operating current assets? Typically, receivables, inventories, and other current assets (excluding cash and short-term investments).\n\nLooking at the balance sheet:\n- Receivables, net: $2,721 million\n- Merchandise inventories: $18,647 million\n- Other current assets: $1,734 million\n\nSo sum of these: 2,721 + 18,647 + 1,734 = $23,102 million.\n\nThen add operating cash (2% of revenue): 5,089.06 million.\n\nTotal operating current assets = 23,102 + 5,089.06 = $28,191.06 million.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"operating current assets,\" and sometimes cash is excluded from operating assets. However, the problem specifically says to assume 2% of revenue is operating cash, so they're including it as part of operating current assets. So we need to include that 2% as operating cash.\n\nBut let me double-check. In some contexts, operating cash is part of operating current assets. So the calculation would be:\n\nOperating current assets = (Receivables + Inventories + Other Current Assets) + Operating Cash (2% of revenue)\n\nBut wait, the balance sheet lists \"Cash and cash equivalents\" as $9,906 million. If operating cash is 2% of revenue ($5,089 million), then perhaps the cash and cash equivalents should be adjusted to reflect that operating cash is $5,089 million, and the rest is non-operating. But the problem doesn't say to adjust the cash balance; it just says to assume that 2% of revenue is operating cash. So maybe they want us to take the standard operating current assets (excluding cash) and add the 2% as operating cash.\n\nWait, but the standard operating current assets would include cash, but here they're specifying that operating cash is 2% of revenue. So perhaps the problem is defining operating cash as 2% of revenue, and we need to calculate operating current assets as the sum of operating cash plus other operating current assets (receivables, inventories, etc.).\n\nSo:\n\nOperating cash = 2% of total revenue = 0.02 * 254,453 = $5,089.06 million\n\nOther operating current assets = Receivables + Inventories + Other Current Assets = 2,721 + 18,647 + 1,734 = $23,102 million\n\nTotal operating current assets = 5,089.06 + 23,102 = $28,191.06 million\n\nBut let's check the numbers again. Total revenue is $254,453 million. 2% of that is 5,089.06. The other current assets sum to 2,721 + 18,647 + 1,734 = 23,102. So total is 28,191.06, which rounds to $28,191 million.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"operating current assets,\" and in some financial models, operating current assets exclude cash. But here, they're defining operating cash as part of it. So including the 2% as operating cash makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that cash and cash equivalents are part of operating current assets, but they want to adjust it to 2% of revenue. So instead of the $9,906 million cash, we use $5,089 million as operating cash. But that would mean subtracting the existing cash and adding the 2% figure. But the problem doesn't say to adjust the cash balance; it just says to assume that 2% of revenue is operating cash. So perhaps they want us to calculate operating current assets as the sum of all current assets except non-operating items, but with cash being 2% of revenue.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"assuming that 2% of revenue is operating cash.\" So operating cash is 2% of revenue, which is $5,089 million. Then, operating current assets would be operating cash plus other operating current assets (receivables, inventories, etc.). So yes, the calculation I did earlier.\n\nLet me confirm the total revenue. The income statement shows Total revenue as $254,453 million for 2024. So 2% of that is indeed $5,089.06 million.\n\nNow, the other current assets: Receivables $2,721, Merchandise inventories $18,647, Other current assets $1,734. Sum is 2,721 + 18,647 = 21,368; 21,368 + 1,734 = 23,102.\n\nAdding operating cash: 23,102 + 5,089 = 28,191.\n\nSo the answer should be $28,191 million.\n\nWait, but let's check if \"operating current assets\" typically includes all current assets except short-term investments. But the problem specifies to use 2% of revenue as operating cash, so they're probably expecting us to calculate it this way.\n\nAnother way: sometimes operating current assets are defined as current assets minus cash and short-term investments. But here, they're saying operating cash is 2% of revenue, so perhaps they want to replace the cash with that figure.\n\nIf operating current assets = (Total current assets - Cash and cash equivalents - Short-term investments) + Operating cash.\n\nTotal current assets = $34,246 million.\n\nMinus Cash and cash equivalents ($9,906) and Short-term investments ($1,238) = 34,246 - 9,906 - 1,238 = 23,102 million.\n\nThen add operating cash (2% of revenue, $5,089) = 23,102 + 5,089 = 28,191 million.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation. So that's the way to go.\n\nSo the final answer is $28,191 million.\n</think>\n\nTo determine operating current assets in 2024, we calculate the sum of non-cash operating current assets (receivables, inventories, and other current assets) plus operating cash (2% of total revenue).\n\n- **Total revenue (2024)**: $254,453 million  \n  Operating cash = 2% × $254,453 = $5,089.06 million  \n- **Non-cash operating current assets**:  \n  Receivables, net: $2,721 million  \n  Merchandise inventories: $18,647 million  \n  Other current assets: $1,734 million  \n  Total = $2,721 + $18,647 + $1,734 = $23,102 million  \n- **Operating current assets** = $23,102 + $5,089 = $28,191 million  \n\n<answer>:28191",

      "question": "What is operating current liability in 2024?",
      "ground_truth": "$35,035 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"What is operating current liability in 2024?\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall what operating current liabilities are. From my knowledge, operating current liabilities are obligations that arise from a company's core business operations, such as accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue. They're distinct from non-operating liabilities like debt.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, specifically the Consolidated Balance Sheets for September 1, 2024 (the most recent year), I need to identify the current liabilities that are operating in nature.\n\nThe balance sheet lists \"CURRENT LIABILITIES\" with several line items:\n- Accounts payable: $19,421 million\n- Accrued salaries and benefits: $4,794 million\n- Accrued member rewards: $2,435 million\n- Deferred membership fees: $2,501 million\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n- Other current liabilities: $6,210 million\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these are operating versus non-operating. \n\n- Accounts payable: This is typically an operating liability (for goods/services purchased in the normal course of business).\n- Accrued salaries and benefits: Operating (related to employee compensation).\n- Accrued member rewards: Operating (related to loyalty programs, part of core business).\n- Deferred membership fees: This is a bit tricky. Membership fees are a core part of Costco's business model. Deferred membership fees represent revenue recognized over time as members use their memberships, so this is an operating liability.\n- Current portion of long-term debt: This is a financing obligation, not operating.\n- Other current liabilities: This could include various items, but without specifics, I'll assume it's a mix. However, in many cases, \"other current liabilities\" might include operating items like taxes payable or other accrued expenses. But to be precise, I should check if there's a standard classification.\n\nIn financial reporting, operating current liabilities usually exclude debt. So, the current portion of long-term debt ($103 million) should be excluded. \n\nLet me sum up the operating ones:\n- Accounts payable: $19,421\n- Accrued salaries and benefits: $4,794\n- Accrued member rewards: $2,435\n- Deferred membership fees: $2,501\n- Other current liabilities: $6,210\n\nWait, but \"other current liabilities\" might include non-operating items. However, in the absence of specific details, and given that Costco's other current liabilities likely include operating accruals (like taxes, etc.), I'll include it. But I should verify if deferred membership fees are considered operating.\n\nDeferred membership fees: Since membership fees are a core revenue stream, the deferred portion is an operating liability. Similarly, accrued member rewards are part of the operating cycle.\n\nNow, let's sum these:\n19,421 + 4,794 = 24,215\n24,215 + 2,435 = 26,650\n26,650 + 2,501 = 29,151\n29,151 + 6,210 = 35,361\n\nBut wait, the total current liabilities are $35,464 million (as per the balance sheet: \"Total current liabilities 35,464\"). So, if I sum the items I listed, it should equal the total minus the non-operating part.\n\nTotal current liabilities = $35,464 million\nCurrent portion of long-term debt = $103 million (non-operating)\n\nSo, operating current liabilities = Total current liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt\n= 35,464 - 103 = $35,361 million\n\nThat matches the sum I did earlier. So, the operating current liabilities are $35,361 million.\n\nBut let me double-check. The question is asking for \"operating current liability,\" which might be a typo for \"operating current liabilities.\" In financial terms, it's plural.\n\nAlso, in the balance sheet, \"Other current liabilities\" is $6,210 million. If that includes non-operating items, but typically, in the context of a company like Costco, most current liabilities are operating except for the debt portion. So, excluding the current portion of debt, the rest are operating.\n\nYes, so the calculation is correct: $35,464 total current liabilities minus $103 (current portion of debt) = $35,361 million.\n\nI should confirm if deferred membership fees are considered operating. Since membership fees are a core part of Costco's business (they're a key revenue source), the deferred portion is definitely an operating liability. Similarly, accrued member rewards are part of the operating cycle.\n\nSo, the answer should be $35,361 million.\n\nWait, but let me check the numbers again from the balance sheet:\n\nTotal current liabilities: $35,464\nCurrent portion of long-term debt: $103\nSo, 35,464 - 103 = 35,361.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's it. The operating current liabilities for 2024 are $35,361 million.\n</think>\n\nTo determine operating current liabilities for 2024, identify current liabilities directly tied to core operations (excluding financing-related items like debt). From the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n\n- Total current liabilities: $35,464 million\n- Current portion of long-term debt (non-operating): $103 million\n\nOperating current liabilities = Total current liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt  \n= $35,464 million - $103 million  \n= $35,361 million\n\nThis includes accounts payable, accrued salaries, accrued member rewards, deferred membership fees, and other operating current liabilities (e.g., taxes, accrued expenses), all standard operating items for a retail business like Costco.\n\n<answer>:35361",

      "question": "What is Operating Working Capital for 2024, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash?",
      "ground_truth": "-$6,844 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking for the Operating Working Capital for 2024, using 2% of revenue as the max potential operating cash. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Operating Working Capital (OWC) is. From what I remember, OWC is typically calculated as Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. But the question mentions using 2% of revenue as the max potential operating cash. Hmm, maybe they want to adjust the cash component?\n\nWait, the problem says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" So perhaps instead of using the actual cash and cash equivalents, we should cap it at 2% of revenue. Let me check the context.\n\nLooking at the financial statements provided, for 2024, Total Revenue is $254,453 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Income). So 2% of that would be 0.02 * 254,453 = $5,089.06 million.\n\nBut Operating Working Capital usually includes current assets minus current liabilities. However, the problem specifies to use 2% of revenue as the max operating cash. So maybe they want to replace the actual cash with this 2% figure?\n\nLet me check the current assets and liabilities. From the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 1, 2024:\n\nCurrent Assets:\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $9,906\n- Short-term investments: $1,238\n- Receivables, net: $2,721\n- Merchandise inventories: $18,647\n- Other current assets: $1,734\nTotal Current Assets: $34,246\n\nCurrent Liabilities:\n- Accounts payable: $19,421\n- Accrued salaries and benefits: $4,794\n- Accrued member rewards: $2,435\n- Deferred membership fees: $2,501\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $103\n- Other current liabilities: $6,210\nTotal Current Liabilities: $35,464\n\nOperating Working Capital (without adjustment) would be Current Assets - Current Liabilities = 34,246 - 35,464 = -$1,218 million. But that's negative, which might not make sense. However, the problem mentions using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash. So perhaps they want to adjust the cash component.\n\nWait, the problem says \"max potential operating cash,\" so maybe they want to cap the cash and equivalents at 2% of revenue. The actual cash and equivalents are $9,906, but 2% of revenue is $5,089. So we should replace the $9,906 with $5,089.\n\nSo recalculating Current Assets with adjusted cash:\nOriginal Current Assets: $34,246\nMinus original cash: $9,906\nPlus adjusted cash: $5,089\nSo adjusted Current Assets = 34,246 - 9,906 + 5,089 = 34,246 - 4,817 = 29,429? Wait, let's compute it properly.\n\n34,246 (total current assets) - 9,906 (cash) + 5,089 (adjusted cash) = 34,246 - 9,906 = 24,340; 24,340 + 5,089 = 29,429.\n\nThen, Operating Working Capital = Adjusted Current Assets - Current Liabilities = 29,429 - 35,464 = -$6,035 million.\n\nBut negative OWC might be possible, but the problem says \"max potential operating cash,\" so maybe they want to use the 2% figure as the cash, but perhaps they mean that the operating cash (which is part of current assets) should not exceed 2% of revenue. So the adjustment is to cap cash at 2% of revenue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Operating Working Capital is defined as (Current Assets - Cash) - Current Liabilities, but I'm not sure. Wait, sometimes operating working capital excludes cash and short-term investments. Let me think.\n\nIn some contexts, Operating Working Capital is calculated as (Current Assets - Cash and Cash Equivalents - Short-term Investments) - (Current Liabilities - Short-term Debt). But the problem here specifies to use 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash, so perhaps they want to adjust the cash component.\n\nWait, the problem says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" So \"operating cash\" here might refer to the cash that's considered part of operating activities, so maybe they want to cap the cash balance at 2% of revenue.\n\nSo, the actual cash and equivalents are $9,906, but the max allowed is 2% of revenue. Revenue is $254,453 million, so 2% is $5,089.06 million. So we replace the $9,906 with $5,089.\n\nSo the adjusted current assets would be:\n\nOriginal current assets: $34,246\n\nMinus cash: $9,906\n\nPlus adjusted cash: $5,089\n\nSo adjusted current assets = 34,246 - 9,906 + 5,089 = 34,246 - 4,817 = 29,429.\n\nThen, OWC = Adjusted Current Assets - Current Liabilities = 29,429 - 35,464 = -6,035.\n\nBut the problem might expect a positive number, or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe \"operating cash\" refers to the cash used in operations, but the question says \"max potential operating cash,\" so perhaps they want to set the cash at 2% of revenue, and then compute OWC as (Current Assets - Cash) - Current Liabilities, but that might not be standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Operating Working Capital is defined as (Current Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Debt), but I'm not sure. Let's check standard definitions.\n\nOperating Working Capital (OWC) is typically Current Assets minus Current Liabilities, but sometimes it's adjusted to exclude cash and short-term investments. However, the problem specifically says to use 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash, so they want to cap the cash component.\n\nSo, the standard OWC would be Current Assets - Current Liabilities = 34,246 - 35,464 = -1,218.\n\nBut with the adjustment, we replace cash with 2% of revenue. So the new cash is 5,089 instead of 9,906. So the new current assets would be 34,246 - 9,906 + 5,089 = 29,429.\n\nThen OWC = 29,429 - 35,464 = -6,035.\n\nBut the problem might expect the answer to be positive, so maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps \"operating cash\" refers to the cash that's part of operating activities, but the problem says \"max potential operating cash,\" so maybe they want to use 2% of revenue as the cash, and then compute OWC as (Current Assets - Cash) - Current Liabilities. Wait, but that would be (34,246 - 5,089) - 35,464 = 29,157 - 35,464 = -6,307. But that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to calculate the operating cash as 2% of revenue, and then OWC is (Current Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Other Current Liabilities), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the problem statement again: \"Operating Working Capital for 2024, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\"\n\nSo \"max potential operating cash\" is 2% of revenue. So the cash component should not exceed 2% of revenue. So the actual cash is $9,906, but the max allowed is $5,089. So we use $5,089 as the cash in the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the adjusted current assets would be:\n\nCash: $5,089 (instead of $9,906)\n\nOther current assets: $1,238 (short-term investments) + $2,721 (receivables) + $18,647 (inventories) + $1,734 (other) = 1,238 + 2,721 = 3,959; 3,959 + 18,647 = 22,606; 22,606 + 1,734 = 24,340.\n\nThen total adjusted current assets = 24,340 + 5,089 = 29,429.\n\nCurrent liabilities are $35,464.\n\nSo OWC = 29,429 - 35,464 = -6,035.\n\nBut the problem might expect the answer in millions, so -$6,035 million. However, sometimes OWC is presented as a positive number if it's a surplus, but here it's negative, meaning current liabilities exceed current assets.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"max potential operating cash,\" so maybe they want to use the 2% figure as the cash, but perhaps they want to calculate OWC as (Current Assets - Cash) - Current Liabilities, but that would be (34,246 - 5,089) - 35,464 = 29,157 - 35,464 = -6,307. But that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"operating cash\" refers to the cash used in operations, but I think the standard approach here is to cap the cash at 2% of revenue.\n\nLet me check the revenue again. Total revenue is $254,453 million. 2% of that is 5,089.06 million.\n\nSo the adjusted cash is $5,089 million.\n\nOriginal cash was $9,906, so we're reducing it by $4,817 million.\n\nSo the new current assets are 34,246 - 4,817 = 29,429.\n\nCurrent liabilities are 35,464.\n\nSo OWC = 29,429 - 35,464 = -6,035.\n\nBut the problem might expect the answer to be positive, so perhaps I have the formula wrong. Wait, maybe Operating Working Capital is defined as (Current Liabilities - Current Assets), but that's not standard. Usually, it's Current Assets - Current Liabilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the net operating working capital, which is sometimes calculated as (Current Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Debt), but the problem doesn't mention debt.\n\nWait, the problem says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash,\" so the key is to adjust the cash to 2% of revenue, then compute OWC as Current Assets (with adjusted cash) minus Current Liabilities.\n\nSo the answer should be -6,035 million. But let's confirm the numbers.\n\nRevenue: 254,453\n\n2% of revenue: 254,453 * 0.02 = 5,089.06 ≈ 5,089\n\nCurrent Assets: 34,246\n\nCash: 9,906\n\nSo adjusted cash: 5,089\n\nSo adjusted Current Assets = 34,246 - 9,906 + 5,089 = 34,246 - 4,817 = 29,429\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 35,464\n\nOWC = 29,429 - 35,464 = -6,035\n\nSo the answer should be -$6,035 million.\n\nBut the problem says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" So probably written as -$6,035.\n\nWait, but let's check if the problem might have a different definition. Sometimes Operating Working Capital is calculated as (Current Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Short-term Debt). But in the balance sheet, the current liabilities include accounts payable, accrued salaries, etc., but not sure about short-term debt.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, the current liabilities include \"Current portion of long-term debt\" which is $103. So maybe short-term debt is part of current liabilities.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention adjusting for that, so probably not.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe \"operating cash\" refers to the cash that's part of operating activities, but the problem says \"max potential,\" so they want to cap it at 2% of revenue. So the calculation as above.\n\nI think the answer is -$6,035 million.\n\nWait, but let's check the numbers again.\n\nTotal revenue: 254,453\n\n2% of 254,453 = 5,089.06\n\nCurrent Assets: 34,246\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 35,464\n\nOriginal OWC: 34,246 - 35,464 = -1,218\n\nAfter adjusting cash to 5,089 (from 9,906), the new current assets are 34,246 - (9,906 - 5,089) = 34,246 - 4,817 = 29,429\n\nOWC = 29,429 - 35,464 = -6,035\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final answer should be -$6,035 million. But the problem says \"in the correct financial format,\" so probably written as -$6,035.\n\nWait, but the numbers are in millions, so it's -$6,035 million. But the answer format might just be the number with the negative sign.\n\nLooking at the instructions: \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\"\n\nSo likely, the answer is -$6,035.\n\nBut let's confirm if the problem expects a positive number. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, another thought: Sometimes Operating Working Capital is defined as (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) but excluding cash. So (Current Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Debt). But the problem says to use 2% of revenue as max operating cash, so maybe they want to include cash but cap it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"operating cash\" is the cash used in operations, so they want to set cash at 2% of revenue, and then OWC is (Current Assets - Cash) - Current Liabilities.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nCurrent Assets - Cash = 34,246 - 9,906 = 24,340\n\nThen, with adjusted cash: 34,246 - 5,089 = 29,157\n\nThen OWC = (29,157) - 35,464 = -6,307\n\nBut that's different from before. Which one is correct?\n\nThe problem states \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" So \"operating cash\" here likely refers to the cash component, so we should replace the actual cash with 2% of revenue. Therefore, the adjusted current assets include the capped cash.\n\nSo the first calculation is correct: adjusted current assets = 34,246 - 9,906 + 5,089 = 29,429\n\nOWC = 29,429 - 35,464 = -6,035\n\nYes, that's the right approach.\n\nSo the final answer is -$6,035.\n</think>\n\n<answer>-$6,035</answer>",

      "question": "Calculate the EBIT Interest Coverage Ratio for 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "33.53x",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this EBIT Interest Coverage Ratio calculation for Costco in 2024. First, I need to recall what the EBIT Interest Coverage Ratio is. From what I remember, it's a measure of a company's ability to pay its interest expenses, calculated as EBIT divided by Interest Expense. EBIT stands for Earnings Before Interest and Taxes.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, I need to find the EBIT and the Interest Expense for 2024. Let me scan through the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nIn the \"OPERATING EXPENSES\" section, there's \"Operating income\" listed as $9,285 million for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024. Operating income is typically EBIT, right? Because it's income before interest and taxes. So EBIT should be $9,285 million.\n\nNext, I need the Interest Expense. In the \"OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)\" section, there's \"Interest expense\" listed as ($169) million. The negative sign indicates an expense, so the Interest Expense is $169 million.\n\nWait, but I should confirm if this is the correct figure. Sometimes companies have different classifications, but in this case, the statement clearly lists \"Interest expense\" under other income/expenses. So yes, Interest Expense is $169 million.\n\nNow, the formula for EBIT Interest Coverage Ratio is EBIT / Interest Expense. So plugging in the numbers: $9,285 / $169.\n\nLet me calculate that. 9,285 divided by 169. Let's see, 169 times 50 is 8,450. 9,285 minus 8,450 is 835. 169 times 4 is 676. 835 minus 676 is 159. So 54 plus 159/169. Approximately 54.94. So about 54.94.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's any adjustment needed. Sometimes EBIT might be adjusted for other items, but in standard financial ratios, EBIT is operating income. The operating income here is $9,285, which is EBIT. The Interest Expense is $169. So the ratio is 9,285 / 169 ≈ 54.94.\n\nBut let me double-check the numbers. The operating income for 2024 is $9,285 million. Interest expense is ($169) million, so the absolute value is $169 million. So 9,285 divided by 169 equals approximately 54.94. Rounding to two decimal places, it's 54.94.\n\nWait, but sometimes ratios are reported as a whole number or with one decimal. Let me confirm the exact calculation. 9,285 ÷ 169. Let's do the division: 169 × 54 = 169 × 50 + 169 × 4 = 8,450 + 676 = 9,126. 9,285 - 9,126 = 159. So 54 + 159/169 ≈ 54 + 0.94 = 54.94. So yes, 54.94.\n\nI should check if there's any other interest-related items that need to be included. The \"Interest income and other, net\" is $624 million, but that's income, not expense. So the Interest Expense is solely the $169 million. So the ratio is EBIT (operating income) divided by Interest Expense.\n\nAnother thing to confirm: sometimes EBITDA is used, but the question specifically says EBIT Interest Coverage Ratio, so it's EBIT, not EBITDA. So operating income is correct.\n\nLooking back at the financials, the \"Operating income\" is indeed $9,285 million, which is EBIT. So the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the EBIT Interest Coverage Ratio for 2024 is 9,285 / 169 ≈ 54.94. The question asks for the final answer in the correct financial format. Typically, such ratios are reported to two decimal places. So 54.94.\n\nWait, but let me check if the Interest Expense is correctly taken as the absolute value. The statement shows \"Interest expense (169)\", which means it's a negative number, so the expense is $169 million. So yes, using 169 as the denominator.\n\nSo the final answer should be 54.94.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the EBIT Interest Coverage Ratio for 2024, use the formula:  \n**EBIT / Interest Expense**.  \n\nFrom the Consolidated Statements of Income:  \n- **EBIT** = Operating Income = **$9,285 million** (52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024).  \n- **Interest Expense** = **$169 million** (from \"Interest expense\" line item, net of interest income).  \n\nCalculation:  \n$9,285 / $169 = **54.94**.  \n\n<answer>:54.94",

      "question": "Calculate the EBITA Interest Coverage Ratio for 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "42.72x",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this EBITA Interest Coverage Ratio question for Costco in 2024. First, I need to recall what EBITA stands for. EBITA is Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization. Wait, but sometimes it's EBITA as Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization, but I should confirm the exact definition here. However, in financial ratios, EBITA might sometimes be used interchangeably with EBIT, but I think in this context, it's EBITA as Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization. Wait, but the standard ratio is usually EBITDA or EBIT. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe question is asking for the EBITA Interest Coverage Ratio. So, the formula should be EBITA divided by Interest Expense. But I need to make sure what EBITA includes. Typically, EBITA might be EBIT plus Amortization, but sometimes it's EBITA as Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization. Wait, but in the context of coverage ratios, it's usually EBIT or EBITDA. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says \"EBITA Interest Coverage Ratio\". So, EBITA is the numerator, and Interest Expense is the denominator. So, EBITA / Interest Expense.\n\nNow, looking at the financial statements provided. The Consolidated Statements of Income for 2024 (52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024) shows:\n\nOperating Income: $9,285 million\n\nBut EBITA would typically be Operating Income plus Amortization. Wait, Operating Income is already after deducting operating expenses, but before interest and taxes. Wait, Operating Income is EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes). So, EBITA might be EBIT plus Amortization. Let me check.\n\nIn the income statement, under Operating Expenses, there's Merchandise Costs and Selling, General, and Administrative. Operating Income is given as $9,285 million. Then, Other Income (Expense) includes Interest Expense of ($169) million. So, Operating Income is EBIT.\n\nBut EBITA would be EBIT plus Amortization. Wait, but Amortization is part of the operating expenses. Let me check the cash flow statement. In the cash flow from operating activities, there's \"Depreciation and amortization\" of $2,237 million for 2024. So, Amortization is part of that. But Operating Income is already after deducting all operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization. So, EBIT (Operating Income) is before interest and taxes, but after depreciation and amortization.\n\nWait, EBIT is Earnings Before Interest and Taxes, which is Operating Income. So, EBIT = Operating Income = $9,285 million.\n\nBut EBITA might be EBIT plus Amortization. Wait, but why would you add back amortization if it's already included in Operating Income? Wait, no. Operating Income is calculated as Revenue minus COGS minus Operating Expenses (which include depreciation and amortization). So, Operating Income (EBIT) already excludes depreciation and amortization. Wait, no: Operating Expenses include depreciation and amortization. So, Operating Income = Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses (which include depreciation and amortization). Therefore, EBIT (Operating Income) is after depreciation and amortization. So, EBITA would be EBIT plus Amortization. Wait, but that's not standard. Usually, EBITDA is EBIT plus Depreciation and Amortization. So, EBITA might be a typo or a specific term here. But given the problem says EBITA, I'll assume it's EBIT plus Amortization.\n\nWait, but let's check the cash flow statement. The cash flow from operating activities shows \"Depreciation and amortization\" as $2,237 million. So, that's the amount added back to net income to get to operating cash flow. So, EBITDA would be Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization. But the problem says EBITA, not EBITDA. Maybe it's a typo, and they mean EBITDA. But the question specifically says EBITA. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe in some contexts, EBITA is used to mean EBIT plus Amortization. Let's see. If EBIT is Operating Income, then EBITA would be Operating Income + Amortization. But why would you add back amortization if it's already included in Operating Income? Wait, no. Operating Income is after deducting depreciation and amortization. So, to get EBITDA, you add back depreciation and amortization to EBIT. So, EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization.\n\nBut the problem says EBITA. Maybe it's a mistake, and they mean EBITDA. Let's check the numbers. Let's see what the Interest Expense is. From the income statement, Interest Expense is ($169) million, so the absolute value is $169 million.\n\nIf EBITA is EBIT (Operating Income) plus Amortization, then we need to find the Amortization amount. But the cash flow statement shows \"Depreciation and amortization\" as $2,237 million. But we don't have the split between depreciation and amortization. However, in the lease section, there's \"Non-cash lease expense\" of $315 million, which might be part of the operating expenses. Wait, but the Operating Income is given as $9,285 million. Let's see.\n\nWait, the problem might be using EBITA as EBIT (Operating Income) because sometimes \"A\" stands for \"Amortization\" but in this case, maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the question is using EBITA to mean EBIT. Let's check the standard ratio. The Interest Coverage Ratio is usually EBIT / Interest Expense. So, if they say EBITA, maybe it's a mistake, and they mean EBIT.\n\nLooking at the numbers: Operating Income (EBIT) is $9,285 million. Interest Expense is $169 million (the negative number in the income statement). So, the ratio would be 9,285 / 169 ≈ 54.94.\n\nBut let's confirm. The Interest Expense is listed as (169), so it's a negative, meaning it's an expense. So, the absolute value is $169 million.\n\nSo, EBITA Interest Coverage Ratio = EBITA / Interest Expense.\n\nAssuming EBITA is EBIT (Operating Income), then it's 9,285 / 169 ≈ 54.94.\n\nBut why would they say EBITA? Maybe in some contexts, EBITA is used, but I think it's a typo. Let's check if there's any other part of the financials that might clarify.\n\nLooking at the income statement, there's \"Operating income\" of $9,285 million. That's EBIT. Then, \"Interest expense\" of ($169) million. So, the standard Interest Coverage Ratio is EBIT / Interest Expense = 9,285 / 169.\n\nCalculating that: 9,285 ÷ 169. Let's do the division.\n\n169 × 50 = 8,450\n\n9,285 - 8,450 = 835\n\n169 × 4 = 676\n\n835 - 676 = 159\n\n169 × 0.94 ≈ 159\n\nSo, 50 + 4 + 0.94 = 54.94.\n\nSo, approximately 54.94.\n\nBut the question says \"EBITA\", so maybe they want EBITDA. Let's check EBITDA. EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation and Amortization. The cash flow statement shows Depreciation and Amortization as $2,237 million. So, EBITDA = 9,285 + 2,237 = 11,522.\n\nThen, EBITDA / Interest Expense = 11,522 / 169 ≈ 68.18.\n\nBut the problem says EBITA, not EBITDA. So, maybe it's a typo, and they mean EBIT. In many contexts, EBITA might be a mistake for EBITDA, but given the problem states EBITA, perhaps they just mean EBIT.\n\nWait, another possibility: EBITA could stand for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, and Amortization. But that would be EBIT plus Amortization, which is the same as EBITDA. Wait, no. EBIT is before interest and taxes. If you add back amortization, it's EBITDA. So, EBITA might be a typo for EBITDA.\n\nBut the problem says \"EBITA\", so maybe they want EBIT plus Amortization. Let's see. If EBIT is 9,285, and Amortization is part of the 2,237, but we don't have the exact Amortization amount. The cash flow statement says \"Depreciation and amortization\" as 2,237. So, if we assume that Amortization is a portion of that, but without knowing the split, we can't separate it. However, in many cases, especially for companies like Costco, the majority of the depreciation and amortization is depreciation, but sometimes they have intangible amortization.\n\nBut the problem might be using EBITA to mean EBIT, given that the standard ratio is EBIT / Interest Expense. Let's check the numbers again.\n\nThe problem states \"EBITA Interest Coverage Ratio\". If it's a typo and should be EBITDA, then it's 11,522 / 169 ≈ 68.18. But if it's EBIT, it's 54.94.\n\nBut let's look at the context. The user provided the financial statements, and in the income statement, Operating Income is EBIT. So, the standard Interest Coverage Ratio is EBIT / Interest Expense. So, the answer is likely 9,285 / 169.\n\nCalculating that precisely: 9,285 ÷ 169.\n\nLet me do the division:\n\n169 × 54 = 169 × 50 + 169 × 4 = 8,450 + 676 = 9,126\n\n9,285 - 9,126 = 159\n\n159 / 169 ≈ 0.9408\n\nSo, 54.9408, which rounds to approximately 54.94.\n\nBut the question says \"EBITA\", so maybe they want EBIT plus Amortization. But without knowing the exact Amortization amount, we can't calculate that. The cash flow statement shows Depreciation and Amortization as 2,237, but we don't know how much is Amortization. However, in the lease section, there's \"Non-cash lease expense\" of 315, which might be part of the operating expenses. Wait, but Operating Income is already calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using EBITA to mean EBIT, and \"A\" is a typo. Given that, the answer is 9,285 / 169 ≈ 54.94.\n\nBut let's check if there's any other part of the financials that might clarify. The \"Other Income (Expense)\" section shows Interest Expense of (169), so that's the interest expense.\n\nSo, the Interest Coverage Ratio is EBIT / Interest Expense = 9,285 / 169.\n\nCalculating that: 9,285 ÷ 169.\n\nLet me use a calculator for precision.\n\n169 × 54 = 9,126\n\n9,285 - 9,126 = 159\n\n159 ÷ 169 = 0.9408\n\nSo, 54.9408, which is approximately 54.94.\n\nBut the problem might expect rounding to two decimal places, so 54.94.\n\nHowever, sometimes financial ratios are reported as whole numbers or with one decimal. But the question doesn't specify. Given the numbers, 54.94 is accurate.\n\nWait, but let's confirm if EBITA is indeed EBIT. In some contexts, EBITA is used to mean EBIT plus Amortization, but since we don't have the exact Amortization figure, and the problem likely expects the standard EBIT, I think it's safe to go with EBIT.\n\nAnother angle: The problem says \"EBITA Interest Coverage Ratio\". If it's a typo for EBITDA, then it's EBITDA / Interest Expense. EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization = 9,285 + 2,237 = 11,522. Then 11,522 / 169 ≈ 68.18.\n\nBut the problem says EBITA, not EBITDA. So, I think it's a typo, but given the options, the standard ratio is EBIT / Interest Expense. So, the answer should be 9,285 / 169 ≈ 54.94.\n\nWait, but let's check the exact wording. The question says \"EBITA Interest Coverage Ratio\". In some financial contexts, EBITA is used to exclude amortization, but that's not standard. Typically, EBITDA is used. So, this is likely a typo, and they mean EBITDA. But the problem says EBITA, so maybe they want EBIT.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"A\" stands for \"Amortization\", so EBITA = EBIT + Amortization. But again, without knowing the Amortization amount, we can't calculate it. However, the cash flow statement lists \"Depreciation and amortization\" as 2,237, so if we assume that Amortization is part of that, but we don't have the split. However, in many cases, especially for retail companies like Costco, the majority of the depreciation and amortization is depreciation, and amortization is minimal. But the problem might be expecting us to use Operating Income as EBITA.\n\nGiven that, and since the problem is likely testing the standard Interest Coverage Ratio (EBIT / Interest Expense), I think the intended answer is 9,285 / 169 ≈ 54.94.\n\nSo, the final answer should be approximately 54.94.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:54.94",

      "question": "Calculate ROE for 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "30.27%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to calculate the ROE (Return on Equity) for Costco for 2024. Let me recall what ROE is. ROE is a measure of a company's profitability, calculated as Net Income divided by Shareholders' Equity. The formula is:\n\nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity\n\nBut I need to check if it's using ending equity or average equity. Typically, for annual reports, it's common to use the average of the beginning and ending equity for the year. However, sometimes companies use ending equity. I should look at the context provided.\n\nLooking at the financial statements, I see the Consolidated Balance Sheets for September 1, 2024 (end of 2024) and September 3, 2023 (end of 2023). So for 2024, the beginning equity would be the September 3, 2023 balance, and ending equity is September 1, 2024.\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n\n- Total Equity as of September 3, 2023 (beginning of 2024): $25,058 million\n- Total Equity as of September 1, 2024 (end of 2024): $23,622 million\n\nSo average equity would be (25,058 + 23,622) / 2 = 48,680 / 2 = $24,340 million.\n\nNow, Net Income for 2024. From the Consolidated Statements of Income, under \"Net income attributable to Costco\" it's $7,367 million.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The statement says:\n\n\"Net income attributable to Costco $ 7,367 $ 6,292 $ 5,844\"\n\nYes, so for 2024, it's $7,367 million.\n\nSo ROE = Net Income / Average Equity = 7,367 / 24,340\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 7,367 ÷ 24,340.\n\nLet me do the division: 7367 / 24340 ≈ 0.3026 or 30.26%.\n\nBut I should check if the problem expects it as a percentage or decimal. Typically, ROE is reported as a percentage.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the equity. The Balance Sheet shows \"Total Equity\" as $23,622 million as of Sept 1, 2024, and $25,058 million as of Sept 3, 2023.\n\nYes, so average is (25,058 + 23,622)/2 = 24,340.\n\nNet Income is $7,367 million.\n\nSo 7,367 / 24,340 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n7,367 ÷ 24,340 = ?\n\n24,340 × 0.3 = 7,302\n\n7,367 - 7,302 = 65\n\nSo 0.3 + (65 / 24,340) ≈ 0.3 + 0.00267 ≈ 0.30267 or 30.27%.\n\nBut let's do it more precisely.\n\n7,367 ÷ 24,340 = ?\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 736.7 / 2,434\n\n2,434 × 0.3 = 730.2\n\n736.7 - 730.2 = 6.5\n\nSo 0.3 + (6.5 / 2,434) ≈ 0.3 + 0.00267 ≈ 0.30267\n\nSo 30.27%.\n\nBut I should check if the problem uses ending equity instead of average. Sometimes in financial ratios, especially if not specified, they might use ending equity. But standard practice is to use average equity for ROE.\n\nLooking at the context, the problem says \"Calculate ROE for 2024.\" Without specifying, but in financial reporting, ROE is typically calculated with average equity.\n\nLet me check the provided data again.\n\nFrom the Balance Sheet:\n\nTotal Equity as of Sept 3, 2023 (beginning of 2024): $25,058 million\n\nTotal Equity as of Sept 1, 2024 (end of 2024): $23,622 million\n\nSo average = (25,058 + 23,622)/2 = 24,340 million.\n\nNet Income for 2024: $7,367 million.\n\nROE = 7,367 / 24,340 ≈ 0.3026 or 30.26%.\n\nRounded to two decimal places, it's 30.26%.\n\nBut let me confirm the exact numbers.\n\n25,058 + 23,622 = 48,680\n\n48,680 / 2 = 24,340\n\n7,367 / 24,340 = ?\n\nLet me compute 7367 ÷ 24340.\n\n24340 × 0.3 = 7302\n\n7367 - 7302 = 65\n\n65 / 24340 = 0.00267\n\nSo 0.30267, which is 30.27% when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nBut in financial contexts, ROE is often reported to two decimal places.\n\nWait, but let's see if the problem expects a specific format. The instruction says \"in the correct financial format.\"\n\nTypically, ROE is presented as a percentage with two decimal places.\n\nSo 30.27%.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other consideration. For example, sometimes ROE uses net income attributable to common shareholders, which is already given as $7,367 million.\n\nYes, the \"Net income attributable to Costco\" is $7,367 million, which is the correct numerator.\n\nAlso, equity is total equity, which includes common stock, additional paid-in capital, accumulated other comprehensive loss, retained earnings, etc. The balance sheet shows \"Total Equity\" as $23,622 million, which is the correct denominator.\n\nSo the calculation should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the Consolidated Statements of Equity to see if there's any adjustment. The equity includes \"Total Stockholders' Equity\" which is $23,622 million as of Sept 1, 2024.\n\nYes.\n\nSo ROE = 7,367 / [(25,058 + 23,622)/2] = 7,367 / 24,340 ≈ 30.27%.\n\nBut let me compute it exactly.\n\n7,367 ÷ 24,340 = ?\n\nLet me do the division:\n\n24,340 × 0.302 = 24,340 × 0.3 = 7,302; 24,340 × 0.002 = 48.68; total 7,302 + 48.68 = 7,350.68\n\n7,367 - 7,350.68 = 16.32\n\nSo 0.302 + (16.32 / 24,340) ≈ 0.302 + 0.00067 ≈ 0.30267\n\nSo 30.267%, which rounds to 30.27%.\n\nTherefore, the ROE for 2024 is 30.27%.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects it without the percentage sign, or as a decimal. Typically, ROE is reported as a percentage.\n\nIn the context of the problem, the answer should be in the format like \"30.27%\".\n\nWait, but the instruction says \"concise, in the correct financial format\". So probably \"30.27%\".\n\nBut let me confirm with the numbers once more.\n\nNet Income: $7,367 million\n\nAverage Equity: (25,058 + 23,622)/2 = 24,340 million\n\nROE = 7,367 / 24,340 = 0.30267 ≈ 30.27%\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it. So the final answer should be 30.27%.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate ROE (Return on Equity) for 2024, use the formula:  \nROE = Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity  \n\n- **Net Income attributable to Costco (2024)**: $7,367 million (from Consolidated Statements of Income)  \n- **Beginning Equity (Sept 3, 2023)**: $25,058 million (from Consolidated Balance Sheet)  \n- **Ending Equity (Sept 1, 2024)**: $23,622 million (from Consolidated Balance Sheet)  \n- **Average Equity** = ($25,058 + $23,622) / 2 = $24,340 million  \n\nROE = $7,367 / $24,340 = 0.30267 ≈ **30.27%**  \n\n<answer>:30.27%",

      "question": "Calculate ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "$3,457.24",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this ARPU calculation for Costco in 2024. First, I need to recall what ARPU stands for—Average Revenue Per User. In the context of a company like Costco, which has membership fees, ARPU would typically refer to the average revenue generated per member.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, I see a section for \"Membership fees\" under Total Revenue. For the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, the Membership fees are listed as $4,828 million. That's the total membership revenue for the year.\n\nNext, I need the number of members. The membership data is provided in the \"Membership\" section. It states that total paid members were 76,200 thousand (or 76.2 million) in 2024. Wait, let me double-check that. The table shows \"Total paid members\" as 76,200 (in thousands) for 2024. So that's 76,200,000 members.\n\nTo calculate ARPU, I divide the total membership revenue by the number of members. So, $4,828 million divided by 76.2 million members. Let me do that math.\n\nFirst, convert both to the same units. $4,828 million is 4,828,000,000. The number of members is 76,200,000. So, 4,828,000,000 / 76,200,000 = ?\n\nSimplifying, divide numerator and denominator by 1,000: 4,828,000 / 76,200. Then divide both by 100: 48,280 / 762. Let me compute that.\n\n48,280 ÷ 762. Let's see, 762 × 63 = 762 × 60 + 762 × 3 = 45,720 + 2,286 = 48,006. Then 48,280 - 48,006 = 274. So 63 + (274/762) ≈ 63.36. So approximately $63.36 per member.\n\nWait, but the membership fee structure mentions that the annual fee for Gold Star and Business memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies elsewhere. However, the ARPU calculation should use the actual revenue generated, not the fee rate. The membership fees line item is $4,828 million, which is the total revenue from memberships, so that's the correct numerator.\n\nThe number of members is 76,200 thousand (76.2 million). So 4,828 / 76.2 = let's calculate that directly. 4,828 ÷ 76.2.\n\n76.2 × 63 = 76.2 × 60 + 76.2 × 3 = 4,572 + 228.6 = 4,800.6. Then 4,828 - 4,800.6 = 27.4. So 27.4 / 76.2 ≈ 0.36. So total ARPU is $63.36.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other detail I'm missing. The note says \"Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership...\" but the total paid members include both Gold Star and Executive. The membership fees revenue is total, so it should already account for all membership types. The $4,828 million is the total membership revenue, so dividing by total paid members (76.2 million) gives the average.\n\nWait, the membership data table shows \"Total paid members\" as 76,200 (thousand) for 2024. So 76,200,000 members. Membership fees revenue is $4,828 million. So ARPU = 4,828 / 76.2 ≈ 63.36. Rounding to the nearest dollar, it's $63.36, but financial reports often round to two decimal places.\n\nWait, the problem says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" So probably $63.36 or rounded to the nearest dollar. But let's confirm the calculation.\n\n4,828 divided by 76.2:\n\n76.2 × 63 = 4,800.6\n\n4,828 - 4,800.6 = 27.4\n\n27.4 / 76.2 = 0.3596...\n\nSo 63.36. So $63.36.\n\nBut let me check if the membership count is correct. The table says \"Total paid members\" 76,200 (thousand) for 2024. Yes, that's 76.2 million.\n\nAnother thing: the membership fees line item is $4,828 million, which is the total for the year. So yes, dividing that by the number of members gives ARPU.\n\nI think that's it. So the ARPU for 2024 is $63.36.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for Costco in 2024, use the total membership fees revenue divided by the number of paid members:\n\n- **Total membership fees (2024)**: $4,828 million  \n- **Total paid members (2024)**: 76,200 thousand (76.2 million)  \n\nARPU = $4,828 / 76.2 = $63.36  \n\n<answer>:$63.36",

The revenue numbers are:\n\n- United States: $184,143 million\n- Canada: $34,874 million\n- Other International: $35,436 million\n\nTotal revenue is $254,453 million, which matches the consolidated total.\n\nNext, I need the number of stores in each region. The \"Item 2—Properties\" section has the warehouse count as of September 1, 2024:\n\n- United States and Puerto Rico: 614 total (499 owned, 115 leased)\n- Canada: 108 total (91 owned, 17 leased)\n- Other International: 168 total (113 owned, 55 leased)\n\nSo the store counts per region are:\n- US: 614\n- Canada: 108\n- Other International: 168\n\nNow, calculate revenue per store for each:\n\nUS: $184,143 / 614 ≈ $300.07 million per store\nCanada: $34,874 / 108 ≈ $322.91 million per store\nOther International: $35,436 / 168 ≈ $210.93 million per store\n\nWait, but the question says \"revenue per store cut by geography.\" The term \"cut\" might be a typo for \"by\" or \"broken down by.\" So they want the revenue per store for each geographic segment.\n\nI should verify if the store counts are correct. The \"Item 2\" shows total warehouses as 890, which adds up: 614 + 108 + 168 = 890. That matches. So the counts per segment are accurate.\n\nNow, the revenue per store calculations. Let me do the math precisely.\n\nUS: 184,143 / 614 = let's compute. 184143 ÷ 614. 614 * 300 = 184,200, which is a bit more than 184,143. So 184,143 / 614 ≈ 299.99, which rounds to $300.00 million.\n\nCanada: 34,874 / 108. 108 * 322 = 34,776. 34,874 - 34,776 = 98. So 322 + (98/108) ≈ 322.91.\n\nOther International: 35,436 / 168. 168 * 210 = 35,280. 35,436 - 35,280 = 156. 156 / 168 ≈ 0.928. So 210.928, which is $210.93 million.\n\nThe question asks for the answer in the correct financial format. Typically, revenue per store is presented in millions, rounded to two decimal places.\n\nSo the final answer should list each region's revenue per store. But the question says \"revenue per store cut by geography,\" which might mean they want the figures broken down by geography. The answer should present each segment's revenue per store.\n\nWait, the user might expect a single number, but the question says \"cut by geography,\" implying multiple values. However, the instruction says \"the final answer must be concise.\" Maybe they want the values listed.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is revenue per store cut by geography in 2024?\" So it's asking for the revenue per store for each geographic segment.\n\nIn the context of the financial statements, the answer should be the three values: US, Canada, Other International.\n\nBut the user might expect the answer formatted as a list or in a specific way. Since the instruction says \"concise, in the correct financial format,\" perhaps present each with the region.\n\nBut the example in the instructions says \"final answer must be concise,\" so maybe just the numbers. However, without context, it's unclear. But given the data, the correct approach is to provide each segment's revenue per store.\n\nWait, the problem might have a typo. \"Cut\" should be \"by\" or \"broken down by.\" So the answer is the revenue per store for each region.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nUnited States: $300.00 million per store\n\nCanada: $322.91 million per store\n\nOther International: $210.93 million per store\n\nBut the question says \"revenue per store,\" so it's per store, not per warehouse. The store count is the number of warehouses, so it's revenue per warehouse.\n\nIn the context, \"store\" refers to warehouse. So revenue per warehouse.\n\nNow, checking the numbers again. The total revenue for US is $184,143 million, stores 614. So 184143 / 614 = let's calculate exactly.\n\n184143 ÷ 614:\n\n614 * 300 = 184,200\n\n184,200 - 184,143 = 57 less, so 300 - (57/614) ≈ 300 - 0.0928 ≈ 299.907, which is approximately $299.91 million. Wait, earlier I thought it was 300, but let's do precise division.\n\n184143 ÷ 614:\n\n614 * 299 = 614*(300-1) = 184,200 - 614 = 183,586\n\n184,143 - 183,586 = 557\n\nSo 299 + (557/614) ≈ 299 + 0.907 ≈ 299.91 million.\n\nSimilarly, Canada: 34,874 / 108.\n\n108 * 322 = 34,776\n\n34,874 - 34,776 = 98\n\n98 / 108 ≈ 0.907, so 322.907 ≈ $322.91 million.\n\nOther International: 35,436 / 168.\n\n168 * 210 = 35,280\n\n35,436 - 35,280 = 156\n\n156 / 168 = 0.92857, so 210.92857 ≈ $210.93 million.\n\nSo the precise values are:\n\nUS: $299.91 million\n\nCanada: $322.91 million\n\nOther International: $210.93 million\n\nBut in the initial calculation, I had US as ~300, but it's actually ~299.91. So need to use the exact division.\n\nWait, the total revenue for US is $184,143 million, stores 614.\n\n184,143 / 614 = let's compute with calculator steps.\n\n614 * 299 = 614*300 - 614 = 184,200 - 614 = 183,586\n\n184,143 - 183,586 = 557\n\n557 / 614 ≈ 0.907\n\nSo 299.907, which rounds to $299.91 million.\n\nSimilarly, Canada: 34,874 / 108.\n\n108 * 322 = 34,776\n\n34,874 - 34,776 = 98\n\n98 / 108 ≈ 0.907, so 322.907 → $322.91\n\nOther International: 35,436 / 168.\n\n168 * 210 = 35,280\n\n35,436 - 35,280 = 156\n\n156 / 168 = 0.92857 → 210.92857 → $210.93\n\nSo the correct figures are:\n\nUS: $299.91 million\n\nCanada: $322.91 million\n\nOther International: $210.93 million\n\nBut the question says \"revenue per store cut by geography,\" so the answer should present these three numbers.\n\nHowever, the user might expect the answer in a specific format. The instruction says \"concise, in the correct financial format.\" So perhaps list them as:\n\nUnited States: $299.91 million, Canada: $322.91 million, Other International: $210.93 million\n\nBut since the question is phrased as \"revenue per store cut by geography,\" the answer should be the three values.\n\nWait, but the problem might have a typo, and \"cut\" is supposed to be \"by,\" so it's asking for the revenue per store by geography, meaning the breakdown.\n\nIn the context of the financial statements, the answer should be the three numbers. However, the user might want the answer as a single number, but that doesn't make sense because it's broken down by geography.\n\nLooking at the original question: \"What is revenue per store cut by geography in 2024?\" The word \"cut\" is likely a typo for \"by\" or \"broken down by.\" So the answer is the revenue per store for each region.\n\nGiven that, the final answer should list each region's revenue per store.\n\nBut the instruction says \"the final answer must be concise,\" so perhaps present it as a list in the required format.\n\nThe example in the instructions says \"final answer must be concise,\" so maybe just the numbers with labels.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"end with the exact final answer on a new line, starting with '<answer>:'\"\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n<answer>: United States: $299.91 million, Canada: $322.91 million, Other International: $210.93 million\n\nBut to be precise, in financial contexts, it's common to present per store revenue as a single number per segment, so this should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if the revenue numbers are in millions. Yes, all the revenue figures are in millions (e.g., \"amounts in millions\" in the header). So the revenue per store is in millions of dollars.\n\nSo the answer should be as above.\n\nBut let me confirm the store counts again. The \"Item 2\" says:\n\nUnited States and Puerto Rico: 614 total\n\nCanada: 108\n\nOther International: 168\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the three values.\n</think>\n\n<answer>: United States: $299.91 million, Canada: $322.91 million, Other International: $210.93 million",

      "question": "What was Costco Sames Store Sales growth?",
      "ground_truth": "5%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about Costco's Same-Store Sales growth. The user is asking for the same-store sales growth, which typically refers to comparable sales growth from existing stores, excluding new stores or closures.\n\nFirst, I need to find where the company reports same-store sales growth in the provided financial statements. Looking through the context, I see a section titled \"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" with a subsection \"Net Sales\" that includes a table with \"Comparable Sales\" data.\n\nIn that table, under \"Changes in comparable sales\" for 2024, it shows:\n- U.S.: 4% (2024) vs 7% (2023)\n- Canada: 3% vs 2%\n- Total Company: 16% vs 15% (wait, the table shows \"Total Company\" as 16% for 2024 and 15% for 2023? But the row above says \"Total Company 4% 7% 17%\" which seems inconsistent)\n\nWait, let me read carefully. The table has:\n\"Changes in comparable sales:\nU.S. Canada Total Company 4% 7% 17%\n6% 4% 16%\nOther International 9% 9% 10%\n5% 7% 16%\"\n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at the actual text below the table:\n\n\"Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight decrease in average ticket.\"\n\nAh, here it says \"Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024\" - that's the key number.\n\nBut let me verify with the table. The \"Total Company\" row shows \"16%\" for 2024? That doesn't match the 5% mentioned. Wait, no - looking at the table structure:\n\nThe table has:\n- First row: \"U.S. Canada Total Company\" with \"4% 7% 17%\"\n- Second row: \"6% 4% 16%\"\n- Third row: \"Other International 9% 9% 10%\"\n- Fourth row: \"5% 7% 16%\"\n\nThis is messy. But the text below says \"Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024\" - that's the clear statement.\n\nAlso, in the \"Net Sales\" section, it says \"Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024\".\n\nSo the answer should be 5%.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any other mention. The \"Results of Operations\" section states: \"Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024\".\n\nYes, that's the direct statement. The table might be showing different breakdowns (like by region), but the overall comparable sales growth is stated as 5%.\n\nThe question asks for \"Costco Same Store Sales growth\" - which is the same as comparable sales growth.\n\nSo the answer is 5%.\n\nI should confirm if it's percentage growth, and it's clearly stated as 5% in the text.\n\nThe user wants the answer in the exact format: <answer>: 5%\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the percentage sign. The text says \"increased 5%\", so it's 5%.\n\nAlso, the context mentions \"Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024\" - so the growth rate is 5%.\n\nI think that's it. The answer is 5%.\n</think>\n\nThe question asks for Costco's Same-Store Sales growth. In the \"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" section under \"Net Sales,\" the text explicitly states: \"Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024.\" This refers to same-store sales growth, which is the standard metric for this metric.\n\n<answer>: 5%",

      "question": "How many members churned in 2024?",
      "ground_truth": "6,745",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"How many members churned in 2024?\" \n\nFirst, I need to find information about membership churn in the provided financial statements. The key section might be under \"Membership\" in the notes or the management discussion. \n\nLooking through the context, there's a section titled \"Membership\" near the end. It says: \"Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024.\" \n\nWait, renewal rate is given, but churn rate would be 1 minus renewal rate. So if renewal rate is 90.5% worldwide, then churn rate is 9.5%. But the question asks for the number of members who churned, not the rate. \n\nI need to find the total number of members. The membership data is provided in a table:\n\n\"Total paid members 2024 2023 2022\n63,700 58,800 54,000\"\n\nWait, that's in thousands. So total paid members at the end of 2024 were 63,700 thousand? But the renewal rate is given as 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. \n\nWait, the renewal rate is calculated as the percentage of members who renewed within a certain period. The note says: \"Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date.\"\n\nSo the renewal rate of 90.5% worldwide means that 90.5% of members renewed, so 9.5% churned. But to find the number, I need the total number of members who were eligible to renew. \n\nThe membership counts include \"active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\" So the total members at the end of 2024 would be the sum of active members plus those not renewed in the last 12 months. But the renewal rate is based on the members who were up for renewal.\n\nThe table shows \"Total paid members\" as 63,700 (thousand) for 2024. But this is the total at the end of the year. The renewal rate is 90.5%, so the number of members who renewed is 90.5% of the total eligible. But the total paid members at the end of 2024 would include those who renewed plus those who didn't renew yet. Wait, no.\n\nActually, the renewal rate is calculated based on the members who were due to renew during the period. The note says: \"Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\" So the total paid members at the end of 2024 (63,700 thousand) includes members who renewed in the past year and those who haven't renewed yet. But the renewal rate of 90.5% means that 90.5% of the members who were up for renewal did renew. \n\nWait, the renewal rate is a rate, not the number. To find churn, I need to know how many members were up for renewal and then apply the churn rate. But the problem is, the total paid members at the end of 2024 is 63,700 thousand. However, the renewal rate is based on the members who renewed during the period. \n\nWait, the note says: \"The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date.\" So the renewal rate is calculated over a trailing period. The renewal rate of 90.5% worldwide means that 90.5% of members who were eligible to renew did so. \n\nBut to get the number of churned members, I need the number of members who did not renew. If the renewal rate is 90.5%, then churn rate is 9.5%. But what is the base? The base should be the number of members who were up for renewal during the year. \n\nThe total paid members at the end of 2023 was 58,800 thousand. The total paid members at the end of 2024 is 63,700 thousand. So the net increase is 63,700 - 58,800 = 4,900 thousand. But this includes new members added during the year. \n\nThe renewal rate is 90.5%, so the number of members who renewed is 90.5% of the members who were up for renewal. Let R be the number of members who were up for renewal. Then renewed = 0.905 * R, and churned = 0.095 * R. \n\nBut the total members at the end of 2024 would be: members who renewed + new members - churned? Wait, no. The total members at the end of 2024 = members who renewed (from the previous year) + new members added during the year. \n\nWait, the membership count at the end of 2024 includes all active members, including those who renewed in 2024 and new members. The renewal rate is based on the members who were due to renew in 2024. \n\nThe total paid members at the end of 2023 was 58,800 thousand. The renewal rate is 90.5%, so the number of members who renewed in 2024 is 90.5% of the members who were up for renewal. But the members who were up for renewal would be the members who had their membership expire in 2024, which is approximately the members at the end of 2023, assuming a steady renewal cycle. \n\nWait, the note says: \"Our membership counts include active memberships as well as memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.\" So the membership count at the end of 2024 includes members who renewed in 2024 and those who haven't renewed yet (but will be counted as churned eventually). \n\nBut the renewal rate is calculated as the percentage of members who renewed during the period. So if the renewal rate is 90.5%, then 90.5% of the members who were eligible to renew did so. The eligible members would be the members who had their membership expire in 2024. \n\nAssuming that the membership base at the end of 2023 (58,800 thousand) is the base for renewal, then the number of members who renewed is 90.5% of 58,800 thousand. But that's not exactly right because some members might have renewed earlier, but the renewal rate is a trailing calculation. \n\nAlternatively, the total paid members at the end of 2024 is 63,700 thousand. The renewal rate is 90.5%, so the number of members who churned would be (1 - 0.905) * total eligible. But what's the total eligible? \n\nWait, the renewal rate is calculated as (renewals / eligible members) * 100. So eligible members = renewals / 0.905. But we don't have renewals directly. \n\nAlternatively, the number of members who churned is the number of eligible members minus renewals. So churned = eligible * (1 - 0.905) = eligible * 0.095. \n\nBut we need to find eligible members. The membership count at the end of 2023 was 58,800 thousand. If we assume that all members at the end of 2023 were eligible to renew in 2024 (since they would have expired in 2024), then eligible = 58,800 thousand. \n\nThus, churned = 58,800 * 0.095 = 5,586 thousand. \n\nBut let's check the numbers. 58,800 * 0.095 = 5,586. So 5,586 thousand members churned. \n\nWait, but the total paid members at the end of 2024 is 63,700. The increase from 58,800 to 63,700 is 4,900 thousand. This increase is due to new members added minus churned members. \n\nSo, new members = (end of 2024 - end of 2023) + churned members. \n\nWait, no. The formula is: \n\nEnd of 2024 = End of 2023 * renewal rate + new members. \n\nBut actually, it's:\n\nEnd of 2024 = (End of 2023 - churned) + new members. \n\nBecause the members who didn't churn (renewed) plus new members equals the end count. \n\nSo, 63,700 = (58,800 - churned) + new members. \n\nBut we don't know new members. However, the renewal rate is 90.5%, so the number of renewals is 90.5% of the eligible members. If eligible members are the members at the end of 2023 (58,800), then renewals = 58,800 * 0.905 = 53,204. \n\nThen, the number of members who churned is 58,800 - 53,204 = 5,596. \n\nWait, 58,800 * 0.905 = let's calculate: 58,800 * 0.9 = 52,920; 58,800 * 0.005 = 294; so total 52,920 + 294 = 53,214. So churned = 58,800 - 53,214 = 5,586. \n\nSo 5,586 thousand members churned. \n\nBut the question is asking for the number, so 5,586,000. But the data is in thousands, so the answer should be 5,586 (thousand), but the question says \"how many members\", so probably in thousands or as a number. \n\nWait, the membership table shows \"Total paid members\" as 63,700, 58,800, etc., which are in thousands. So the answer should be in thousands. \n\nBut let's confirm with the renewal rate. The note says \"Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024.\" So worldwide renewal rate is 90.5%, so churn rate is 9.5%. \n\nAssuming that the eligible members are the total paid members at the end of 2023 (58,800 thousand), then churned = 58,800 * (1 - 0.905) = 58,800 * 0.095 = 5,586 thousand. \n\nSo the answer should be 5,586 thousand, but the question might expect it in the same format as the table, which is in thousands. So the number is 5,586. \n\nWait, but let's check if there's another way. The total paid members at the end of 2024 is 63,700. The renewal rate is 90.5%, so the number of members who renewed is 90.5% of the members who were up for renewal. But the members who were up for renewal would be the members who had their membership expire in 2024, which is the members at the end of 2023, assuming they all expire in 2024. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the number of members who churned in 2024 is 5,586 thousand. But the question says \"how many members\", so the answer should be 5,586,000. However, in the context of the financial statements, they present numbers in thousands, so the answer is likely expected to be 5,586 (thousand), but the question might want the number without the thousand. Wait, the table says \"Total paid members 63,700\" meaning 63,700,000 members. So 63,700 thousand is 63,700,000. \n\nSo 5,586 thousand is 5,586,000 members. But the answer should be in the format as per the question. The question says \"how many members\", so the numerical value. \n\nBut looking at the membership table, the numbers are presented as 63,700 (thousand), so the answer should be 5,586 (thousand), but the question might expect the number without the thousand, so 5586. However, in financial contexts, sometimes they present it as the number in the table's unit. \n\nWait, the problem says \"provide the final answer in the required format\" and \"concise, in the correct financial format\". The membership numbers are in thousands, so the answer should be 5,586. But let's check the calculation again. \n\n58,800 * 0.095 = 5,586. Yes. \n\nSo the answer is 5,586 thousand members. But the question says \"how many members\", so it's 5,586,000. However, in the context of the provided data, they use thousands, so the answer is 5,586. \n\nWait, the membership table says \"Total paid members 2024 2023 2022: 63,700 58,800 54,000\" — these are in thousands. So 58,800 thousand members at the end of 2023. \n\nChurned = 58,800 * (1 - 0.905) = 58,800 * 0.095 = 5,586 thousand. \n\nSo the answer is 5,586. But the question might want it as a number without commas, so 5586. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"in the correct financial format\". In financial statements, they often present numbers with commas, but the answer format might require no commas. \n\nLooking at the instructions: \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\". The membership numbers in the table are written as 63,700, so with commas. But the answer should be a number. \n\nWait, the user's example in the instructions says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\". For example, if it's $1,000, it should be written as 1000 or 1,000? But in the context of the problem, the membership numbers are given as 63,700, so probably with commas. \n\nBut the answer should be the number of members, so 5,586 thousand. But the question says \"how many members\", so it's 5,586,000. However, since the data is in thousands, the answer is 5,586 (thousand), but the question might expect the number as 5586. \n\nWait, let's see the exact wording: \"Total paid members 2024 2023 2022: 63,700 58,800 54,000\" — these are in thousands. So 63,700 means 63,700,000 members. So the churned number is 5,586 thousand, which is 5,586,000 members. But the answer should be presented as 5,586 (since the data is in thousands), but the question asks for \"how many members\", so it's 5,586,000. However, in financial contexts, when they say \"how many\" with data in thousands, they might expect the number in the same unit. \n\nBut the problem says \"provide the final answer in the required format\". The instructions don't specify, but looking at the context, the membership numbers are presented as 63,700 (thousand), so the answer should be 5,586. \n\nWait, but let's check if there's another way. The renewal rate is 90.5%, so churn rate is 9.5%. The total members at the end of 2023 is 58,800 thousand. So churned = 58,800 * 0.095 = 5,586. \n\nYes, that's the calculation. So the answer is 5,586. \n\nBut wait, the note says \"Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024.\" So worldwide renewal rate is 90.5%, so the churn rate is 9.5%. \n\nTherefore, the number of members who churned is 58,800 * 0.095 = 5,586 thousand. \n\nSo the final answer is 5,586.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:5586",

      "question": "How many new members joined in 2024?",
      "ground_truth": "11,945",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"How many new members joined in 2024?\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided financial context to find membership data. The key section should be under \"Membership\" or in the membership counts table.\n\nLooking at the document, there's a section titled \"Membership\" with a table showing membership counts. The table has columns for 2024, 2023, and 2022. The relevant row is \"Total paid members\" which shows 76,200 (thousand) for 2024 and 71,000 (thousand) for 2023. \n\nWait, the question is about new members joined in 2024. So the new members would be the difference between 2024 and 2023 total paid members. \n\nCalculating that: 76,200 - 71,000 = 5,200 thousand. But wait, the table also mentions \"Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.\" However, the total paid members already include Executive members, so the difference in total paid members should reflect new members.\n\nBut let me double-check. The table says \"Total paid members\" for 2024 is 76,200 (thousand), and 2023 is 71,000 (thousand). So the increase is 5,200 thousand. But the question is about new members joined in 2024. However, membership counts can be affected by renewals and new sign-ups. The document also mentions \"Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024.\" But renewal rate is about existing members renewing, not new members.\n\nWait, the total paid members at the end of 2024 would include both new members and renewals. But the difference between 2023 and 2024 total paid members should be the net new members (new sign-ups minus cancellations). However, the question asks for \"new members joined,\" which might refer to gross new members, but typically in such contexts, the change in total members is the net new members. But the problem might be expecting the difference.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 76,200 (2024) minus 71,000 (2023) equals 5,200 thousand. But the problem states \"new members joined,\" which might be the gross number, but the data provided is total paid members. The document doesn't explicitly state the number of new members, but the total paid members increased by 5,200 thousand. \n\nWait, the table says \"Total paid members\" for 2024 is 76,200 (thousand), 2023 is 71,000 (thousand). So the increase is 5,200 thousand. But the question is \"how many new members joined in 2024?\" So the answer should be 5,200,000. But the numbers are in thousands, so 5,200 thousand is 5,200,000. However, the answer format should be in the correct financial format, probably as a number without commas.\n\nWait, the table says \"Total paid members\" in thousands. So 76,200 thousand means 76,200,000 members. So the difference is 5,200 thousand, which is 5,200,000. But the question might expect the answer in thousands, but the problem says \"how many,\" so it's likely expecting the absolute number. However, in financial contexts, sometimes they present it in thousands. But the question doesn't specify. Looking at the context, the numbers are presented in thousands (e.g., \"76,200\" in the table is \"76,200 thousand\"), so the answer should be 5,200 thousand, but written as 5200000 or 5,200,000. However, the instructions say \"in the correct financial format,\" which might mean using the same units as the data. Since the data is in thousands, but the question asks for \"how many,\" it's probably expecting the number without the thousand, but that's confusing.\n\nWait, the table says \"Total paid members\" for 2024 is 76,200 (thousand), so 76,200,000 members. Similarly, 2023 is 71,000 thousand (71,000,000). The difference is 5,200 thousand, which is 5,200,000. So the answer should be 5,200,000. But let's check if there's any other data.\n\nWait, the document also says \"Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):\" and lists Gold Star, Business, etc. But the total paid members is the sum, so the 76,200 is the total. So the increase is 5,200 thousand. But the question is \"how many new members joined,\" which is the net increase. However, sometimes \"new members\" refers to gross new, but the data provided is total members, so the difference is the net new members. The problem likely expects the difference.\n\nSo 76,200 - 71,000 = 5,200 (in thousands). So 5,200 thousand members. But the answer should be in the correct format. The problem says \"in the correct financial format,\" which for such numbers is often written as 5,200,000, but sometimes they keep it in thousands. However, the question says \"how many,\" so it's expecting the actual number. So 5,200,000.\n\nWait, but let's check the exact numbers. The table says:\n\n2024: 76,200\n\n2023: 71,000\n\nDifference: 5,200 (thousand). So 5,200 * 1,000 = 5,200,000.\n\nYes, so the answer should be 5,200,000.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other part of the document that might clarify. The \"Membership\" section also says \"Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024.\" But renewal rate is about existing members renewing, so the new members would be the total increase minus any cancellations. However, the total paid members at the end of the year is the previous year's total minus cancellations plus new members. So the net change (increase) is new members minus cancellations. But the question asks for \"new members joined,\" which might be the gross new, but the data doesn't provide gross new, only the net change. So the answer is the net increase, which is 5,200 thousand.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5,200,000.\n</think>\n\nThe membership data shows total paid members at 76,200 thousand for 2024 and 71,000 thousand for 2023. The difference represents the net new members joined in 2024 (new members minus cancellations). The calculation is 76,200 - 71,000 = 5,200 thousand members, which equals 5,200,000 members.\n\n<answer>:5200000",

      "question": "What's the operating working capital in 2023, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash?",
      "ground_truth": "-$6,662 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking for the operating working capital in 2023, using 2% of revenue as the max potential operating cash. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what operating working capital means. From what I remember, operating working capital is typically calculated as current assets minus current liabilities, but excluding cash and cash equivalents because those are non-operating. Wait, but the question mentions \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" Hmm, maybe they want to adjust for the cash component?\n\nWait, the problem says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\" So perhaps they want to consider that the company can use up to 2% of revenue as operating cash, meaning we should subtract that from the operating working capital calculation? Or maybe the operating cash is part of the working capital, and we need to cap it at 2% of revenue.\n\nLet me check the context. The original question is about operating working capital in 2023. The context provided includes the balance sheet for 2023 (September 3, 2023). \n\nOperating working capital is usually defined as current assets minus current liabilities, but sometimes it's adjusted to exclude cash and cash equivalents. However, the problem specifies \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash,\" which might mean that instead of using the actual cash, we cap the cash at 2% of revenue. So the operating working capital would be (current assets - cash) minus current liabilities, but with cash limited to 2% of revenue.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The standard formula for operating working capital (OWC) is:\n\nOWC = (Current Assets - Cash and Cash Equivalents) - (Current Liabilities - Short-Term Debt)\n\nBut sometimes it's simplified to Current Assets - Current Liabilities, excluding cash and short-term debt. However, the problem here says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash,\" so perhaps they want to replace the actual cash with 2% of revenue.\n\nLooking at the 2023 revenue: from the income statement, Total revenue for 2023 (53 weeks ended September 3, 2023) is $242,290 million.\n\nSo 2% of revenue would be 0.02 * 242,290 = $4,845.8 million.\n\nNow, the balance sheet for 2023 (September 3, 2023) shows:\n\nCurrent Assets: $35,879 million\n\nCash and cash equivalents: $13,700 million\n\nCurrent Liabilities: $33,583 million\n\nIf we're to use 2% of revenue as the max operating cash, then instead of using the actual cash of $13,700, we use $4,845.8 million.\n\nOperating working capital is typically Current Assets - Current Liabilities, but excluding cash. Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nOperating working capital is often calculated as (Current Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Short-Term Debt). But the problem might be simplifying it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to calculate the working capital without the cash, but cap the cash at 2% of revenue. So:\n\nOperating Working Capital = (Current Assets - Cash) - Current Liabilities\n\nBut if the actual cash is higher than 2% of revenue, we replace it with 2% of revenue.\n\nSo, actual cash is $13,700 million, which is way higher than 2% of revenue ($4,845.8 million). So we replace cash with $4,845.8 million.\n\nTherefore, Operating Working Capital = (Current Assets - Max Cash) - Current Liabilities\n\n= (35,879 - 4,845.8) - 33,583\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n35,879 - 4,845.8 = 31,033.2\n\n31,033.2 - 33,583 = -2,549.8\n\nWait, that's negative. But maybe the problem is using a different definition. Alternatively, maybe they want to include the cash but cap it at 2% of revenue, so the operating cash is maxed at 2% of revenue, and the rest is considered non-operating.\n\nWait, another way: Operating Working Capital = (Current Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Short-Term Debt)\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention short-term debt. Let's check the balance sheet.\n\nCurrent Liabilities include \"Current portion of long-term debt 103\" but that's probably not relevant here. The problem says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash,\" so maybe they just want to adjust the cash component.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the operating cash flow, but the question says \"operating working capital,\" which is a balance sheet item.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"operating working capital in 2023, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.\"\n\nSo, operating working capital is usually Current Assets - Current Liabilities, but excluding cash and cash equivalents. However, the problem is saying that instead of using the actual cash, we should use 2% of revenue as the maximum cash that's considered operating. So, if the actual cash is higher than 2% of revenue, we cap it at 2% of revenue.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\nOperating Working Capital = (Current Assets - Cash) - Current Liabilities\n\nBut with Cash replaced by min(actual cash, 2% of revenue)\n\nSince actual cash is $13,700 million, and 2% of revenue is $4,845.8 million, we use $4,845.8 million as the cash.\n\nSo:\n\nCurrent Assets = $35,879 million\n\nMinus the capped cash: $4,845.8 million\n\nSo Current Assets - Capped Cash = 35,879 - 4,845.8 = 31,033.2\n\nCurrent Liabilities = $33,583 million\n\nOperating Working Capital = 31,033.2 - 33,583 = -2,549.8 million\n\nBut negative working capital is possible, especially for companies like Costco which have strong cash flow from operations.\n\nWait, but let's check the numbers again.\n\nRevenue for 2023 is $242,290 million.\n\n2% of that is 0.02 * 242,290 = 4,845.8 million.\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of Sept 3, 2023: $13,700 million.\n\nSo yes, 13,700 > 4,845.8, so we cap cash at 4,845.8.\n\nCurrent Assets: $35,879 million\n\nCurrent Liabilities: $33,583 million\n\nOperating Working Capital = (Current Assets - Capped Cash) - Current Liabilities\n\n= (35,879 - 4,845.8) - 33,583\n\n= 31,033.2 - 33,583\n\n= -2,549.8 million\n\nSo approximately -$2,550 million.\n\nBut the problem says \"operating working capital,\" and sometimes it's presented as a positive number, but negative means the company has more current liabilities than current assets (excluding cash). But let's confirm if the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to calculate it as (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) but with cash adjusted. So:\n\nOriginal Current Assets - Current Liabilities = 35,879 - 33,583 = 2,296 million.\n\nBut then, since cash is higher than 2% of revenue, we subtract the excess cash from the working capital.\n\nExcess cash = 13,700 - 4,845.8 = 8,854.2 million.\n\nSo Operating Working Capital = 2,296 - 8,854.2 = -6,558.2 million. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. If the actual cash is higher than the max allowed (2% of revenue), then the excess cash is considered non-operating, so we subtract it from the working capital.\n\nSo Operating Working Capital = (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) - (Actual Cash - Max Cash)\n\n= (35,879 - 33,583) - (13,700 - 4,845.8)\n\n= 2,296 - 8,854.2\n\n= -6,558.2 million\n\nBut that's different from the previous calculation.\n\nHmm, I need to clarify the correct method.\n\nIn some contexts, operating working capital is defined as:\n\nOperating Working Capital = (Current Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Short-Term Debt)\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention short-term debt, so maybe we ignore that.\n\nSo, Current Assets - Cash = 35,879 - 13,700 = 22,179\n\nCurrent Liabilities = 33,583\n\nSo Operating Working Capital = 22,179 - 33,583 = -11,404\n\nBut then, the problem says to use 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash. So instead of using the actual cash, we use 2% of revenue as the cash component.\n\nSo, Current Assets - Max Cash = 35,879 - 4,845.8 = 31,033.2\n\nThen Operating Working Capital = (Current Assets - Max Cash) - Current Liabilities = 31,033.2 - 33,583 = -2,549.8\n\nWhich is approximately -$2,550 million.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considering that the operating cash should be capped at 2% of revenue, so the cash used in the calculation is 2% of revenue, not the actual cash.\n\nSo the correct calculation should be:\n\nOperating Working Capital = (Current Assets - (2% of revenue)) - Current Liabilities\n\n= (35,879 - 4,845.8) - 33,583\n\n= 31,033.2 - 33,583\n\n= -2,549.8\n\nSo rounding to the nearest million, it's -$2,550 million.\n\nBut let's check if the problem expects a positive number. However, negative working capital is possible, especially for companies with high inventory turnover and strong supplier terms.\n\nLooking at Costco's balance sheet, they have high current liabilities relative to current assets, which is common for retail companies.\n\nAnother way: Maybe the question is referring to the operating cash flow, but it says \"operating working capital,\" which is a balance sheet item.\n\nWait, the problem says \"operating working capital,\" which is a balance sheet item, not cash flow.\n\nSo, based on the calculation, the answer should be -$2,550 million.\n\nBut let's confirm the numbers again.\n\nRevenue 2023: $242,290 million\n\n2% of revenue: 242,290 * 0.02 = 4,845.8 million\n\nCurrent Assets 2023: $35,879 million\n\nCurrent Liabilities 2023: $33,583 million\n\nCapped Cash: $4,845.8 million\n\nOperating Working Capital = (Current Assets - Capped Cash) - Current Liabilities\n\n= (35,879 - 4,845.8) - 33,583\n\n= 31,033.2 - 33,583\n\n= -2,549.8\n\nSo, -$2,550 million.\n\nThe problem says \"in the correct financial format,\" so probably as a negative number, maybe rounded to the nearest million.\n\nSo the final answer should be -$2,550 million, but written as -2550 (in millions).\n\nWait, the context uses \"amounts in millions,\" so the answer should be in millions, and the number is negative.\n\nSo, the answer is -2550.\n\nBut let's check if there's another way. Maybe they want to calculate it as (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) but with cash adjusted.\n\nOriginal Current Assets - Current Liabilities = 35,879 - 33,583 = 2,296\n\nBut since cash is higher than 2% of revenue, the excess cash is 13,700 - 4,845.8 = 8,854.2\n\nSo the operating working capital would be 2,296 - 8,854.2 = -6,558.2, but that doesn't align with standard definitions.\n\nI think the first method is correct: using the capped cash in the calculation.\n\nAnother source: Operating working capital is often calculated as (Current Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Short-Term Debt). But since the problem doesn't mention short-term debt, and the current liabilities include \"Current portion of long-term debt\" which is $103, but that's probably not relevant.\n\nAssuming we don't subtract short-term debt, then:\n\nOperating Working Capital = (Current Assets - Cash) - Current Liabilities\n\nBut with Cash replaced by 2% of revenue.\n\nSo:\n\n(35,879 - 4,845.8) - 33,583 = -2,549.8\n\nYes, that's the same as before.\n\nSo the answer should be -$2,550 million, which in the required format is -2550.\n\nWait, the problem says \"in the correct financial format,\" so probably as a number with commas or without. But since the context uses numbers like $35,879, but the answer should be concise.\n\nThe instruction says \"concise, in the correct financial format,\" so likely as a number without commas, in millions.\n\nSo, -2550.\n\nBut let's check if the problem expects a positive number. Maybe I made a mistake in the definition.\n\nWait, another possibility: Operating working capital is sometimes defined as (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) excluding cash and short-term debt. But the problem says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash,\" so perhaps they want to include cash up to 2% of revenue, and the rest is considered non-operating.\n\nSo, the operating cash is 2% of revenue, so the non-operating cash is actual cash minus 2% of revenue.\n\nThen, Operating Working Capital = (Current Assets - Non-Operating Cash) - Current Liabilities\n\n= (35,879 - (13,700 - 4,845.8)) - 33,583\n\n= (35,879 - 8,854.2) - 33,583\n\n= 27,024.8 - 33,583\n\n= -6,558.2\n\nBut this seems less likely. The standard approach is to exclude cash from working capital, but here they're capping the cash at 2% of revenue.\n\nI think the first method is correct. Let's see if there's a standard way this is done in finance.\n\nUpon a quick check, some analysts use a normalized cash balance for working capital calculations, such as a percentage of revenue. So, if the company's cash is higher than a certain percentage, they adjust it down to that percentage for the purpose of calculating operating working capital.\n\nSo, the correct calculation would be to replace the actual cash with 2% of revenue, then compute (Current Assets - Cash) - Current Liabilities.\n\nWait, no: (Current Assets - Cash) - Current Liabilities would be the operating working capital without cash. But if we're capping cash, then it's (Current Assets - Capped Cash) - Current Liabilities.\n\nYes, because Current Assets includes cash, so if we want to exclude cash (or cap it), we subtract the capped cash.\n\nSo, the calculation is correct as -2,550 million.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is -2550.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:-2550</answer>",

But sometimes it's defined as (current assets - cash) - (current liabilities - short-term debt). Wait, but the problem mentions \"max potential operating cash\" as 2% of revenue. Maybe they want to adjust the cash component to be no more than 2% of revenue? Let me check the revenue figures.\n\nFrom the income statement, total revenue for 2024 is $254,453 million, and for 2023 it's $242,290 million. So 2% of 2024 revenue would be 0.02 * 254,453 = $5,089.06 million. For 2023, 2% of 242,290 is $4,845.8 million.\n\nBut how does this relate to operating working capital? Maybe the problem is saying that the cash component in operating working capital should be capped at 2% of revenue. So instead of using the actual cash, we use 2% of revenue as the \"operating cash\" for the calculation.\n\nOperating working capital (OWC) is typically calculated as:\n\nOWC = (Current Assets - Cash and Cash Equivalents) - (Current Liabilities - Short-Term Debt)\n\nBut sometimes it's (Current Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Current Portion of Long-Term Debt). Let's check the balance sheet.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet for 2024:\n\nCurrent Assets: $34,246 million\n\nCash and cash equivalents: $9,906 million\n\nCurrent Liabilities: $35,464 million\n\nCurrent portion of long-term debt: $103 million\n\nSo, if we exclude cash and exclude current portion of debt, then:\n\nOperating Current Assets = Current Assets - Cash = 34,246 - 9,906 = $24,340 million\n\nOperating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Current Portion of Debt = 35,464 - 103 = $35,361 million\n\nThen OWC = 24,340 - 35,361 = -$11,021 million\n\nWait, but that's negative. But maybe the problem wants to adjust cash to 2% of revenue. So instead of using actual cash, use 2% of revenue as the cash figure.\n\nFor 2024, 2% of revenue is 0.02 * 254,453 = $5,089.06 million. So Operating Current Assets would be Current Assets - (2% of revenue) = 34,246 - 5,089.06 = $29,156.94 million\n\nThen Operating Current Liabilities would be Current Liabilities - Current Portion of Debt = 35,464 - 103 = $35,361 million\n\nOWC = 29,156.94 - 35,361 = -$6,204.06 million\n\nSimilarly for 2023:\n\nRevenue 2023: $242,290 million\n\n2% of revenue: 0.02 * 242,290 = $4,845.8 million\n\nCurrent Assets 2023: $35,879 million\n\nCash and cash equivalents: $13,700 million\n\nOperating Current Assets (adjusted) = 35,879 - 4,845.8 = $31,033.2 million\n\nOperating Current Liabilities = 33,583 - 1,081 = $32,502 million\n\nOWC = 31,033.2 - 32,502 = -$1,468.8 million\n\nThen the change in OWC from 2023 to 2024 would be OWC_2024 - OWC_2023 = (-6,204.06) - (-1,468.8) = -6,204.06 + 1,468.8 = -$4,735.26 million\n\nBut the problem says \"change in operating working capital\", which is usually the difference. However, sometimes it's presented as the absolute change. But the negative sign here indicates a decrease in OWC (since it's more negative), meaning that operating working capital decreased by $4,735 million.\n\nWait, but let me verify if the calculation is correct. Let's check the numbers again.\n\nFor 2024:\n\nRevenue: 254,453\n\n2% of revenue: 5,089.06\n\nCurrent Assets: 34,246\n\nAdjusted Current Assets (excluding cash): 34,246 - 5,089.06 = 29,156.94\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 35,464\n\nCurrent portion of debt: 103\n\nOperating Current Liabilities: 35,464 - 103 = 35,361\n\nOWC = 29,156.94 - 35,361 = -6,204.06\n\nFor 2023:\n\nRevenue: 242,290\n\n2% of revenue: 4,845.8\n\nCurrent Assets: 35,879\n\nAdjusted Current Assets: 35,879 - 4,845.8 = 31,033.2\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 33,583\n\nCurrent portion of debt: 1,081\n\nOperating Current Liabilities: 33,583 - 1,081 = 32,502\n\nOWC = 31,033.2 - 32,502 = -1,468.8\n\nChange = (-6,204.06) - (-1,468.8) = -4,735.26\n\nSo the change is approximately -$4,735 million. But the problem says \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash\". So they want to cap the cash at 2% of revenue, meaning that instead of using actual cash, we use 2% of revenue as the cash figure. So the calculation above is correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way. Sometimes operating working capital is calculated as (Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets) - (Accounts Payable + Accrued Liabilities). Let's see if that's the case.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\nFor 2024:\n\nReceivables, net: 2,721\n\nMerchandise inventories: 18,647\n\nOther current assets: 1,734\n\nTotal Operating Current Assets = 2,721 + 18,647 + 1,734 = 23,102\n\nCurrent Liabilities:\n\nAccounts payable: 19,421\n\nAccrued salaries and benefits: 4,794\n\nAccrued member rewards: 2,435\n\nDeferred membership fees: 2,501\n\nOther current liabilities: 6,210\n\nTotal Operating Current Liabilities = 19,421 + 4,794 + 2,435 + 2,501 + 6,210 = 35,361\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So OWC = 23,102 - 35,361 = -12,259 million. But this doesn't include cash, which is why it's different from the previous calculation. Wait, but in this case, the operating current assets are receivables, inventory, and other current assets, excluding cash. So this is a different approach.\n\nBut the problem mentions \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash\". So maybe they want to adjust the cash component. But in this calculation, cash isn't included in operating current assets. So perhaps the problem is referring to a different definition.\n\nWait, the problem says \"max potential operating cash\", which might mean that they are considering cash as part of operating assets, but capping it at 2% of revenue. So instead of using the actual cash, they use 2% of revenue as the cash figure. So the operating current assets would be (Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets + Cash) but capped at 2% of revenue. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. If cash is part of operating assets, but they want to cap it at 2% of revenue, then the total operating current assets would be (Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets) + min(Cash, 2% of revenue).\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFor 2024:\n\nReceivables: 2,721\n\nInventory: 18,647\n\nOther Current Assets: 1,734\n\nTotal = 23,102\n\nCash: 9,906\n\n2% of revenue: 5,089.06\n\nSo the adjusted cash is 5,089.06 (since 5,089 < 9,906)\n\nSo Operating Current Assets = 23,102 + 5,089.06 = 28,191.06\n\nOperating Current Liabilities = 35,361 (as before)\n\nOWC = 28,191.06 - 35,361 = -7,169.94\n\nFor 2023:\n\nReceivables: 2,285\n\nInventory: 16,651\n\nOther Current Assets: 1,709\n\nTotal = 20,645\n\nCash: 13,700\n\n2% of revenue: 4,845.8\n\nAdjusted cash: 4,845.8\n\nOperating Current Assets = 20,645 + 4,845.8 = 25,490.8\n\nOperating Current Liabilities = 33,583 - 1,081 = 32,502\n\nOWC = 25,490.8 - 32,502 = -7,011.2\n\nChange = (-7,169.94) - (-7,011.2) = -158.74 million\n\nBut this seems different. However, the problem states \"using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash\", which might mean that the cash component is capped at 2% of revenue, so we replace the actual cash with 2% of revenue in the calculation.\n\nBut which definition of OWC is correct? The standard definition of operating working capital is usually current assets (excluding cash and short-term investments) minus current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). But sometimes it's defined as (current assets - cash) - (current liabilities - current debt).\n\nIn the first approach I took, I subtracted cash from current assets, but the problem says to use 2% of revenue as the max cash, so instead of subtracting actual cash, we subtract 2% of revenue.\n\nSo for 2024:\n\nCurrent Assets: 34,246\n\nMinus 2% of revenue (5,089.06) = 34,246 - 5,089.06 = 29,156.94\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 35,464\n\nMinus current portion of debt (103) = 35,361\n\nOWC = 29,156.94 - 35,361 = -6,204.06\n\nFor 2023:\n\nCurrent Assets: 35,879\n\nMinus 2% of revenue (4,845.8) = 35,879 - 4,845.8 = 31,033.2\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 33,583\n\nMinus current portion of debt (1,081) = 32,502\n\nOWC = 31,033.2 - 32,502 = -1,468.8\n\nChange = -6,204.06 - (-1,468.8) = -4,735.26\n\nSo approximately -$4,735 million.\n\nBut let's check if the problem might have a different approach. The question says \"change in operating working capital\", which is usually the difference between the two years. So the change is OWC_2024 - OWC_2023 = -6,204 - (-1,469) = -4,735.\n\nBut the problem might expect the absolute value, but usually, the sign matters. A negative change means OWC decreased.\n\nWait, but let's confirm with the cash flow statement. The cash flow from operations shows changes in operating assets and liabilities. For example, in the cash flow statement, \"Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Merchandise inventories (2,068)...\" which is a use of cash, meaning inventory increased, so OWC increased. But the problem is asking for the change in OWC, not the cash flow.\n\nAnother way: Operating Working Capital = (Current Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Current Debt)\n\nSo for 2024:\n\nCurrent Assets - Cash = 34,246 - 9,906 = 24,340\n\nCurrent Liabilities - Current Debt = 35,464 - 103 = 35,361\n\nOWC = 24,340 - 35,361 = -11,021\n\nFor 2023:\n\nCurrent Assets - Cash = 35,879 - 13,700 = 22,179\n\nCurrent Liabilities - Current Debt = 33,583 - 1,081 = 32,502\n\nOWC = 22,179 - 32,502 = -10,323\n\nChange = -11,021 - (-10,323) = -698\n\nBut this is without the 2% cap. The problem says to use 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash. So they want to adjust the cash component to be 2% of revenue, not the actual cash.\n\nSo in the standard calculation, we subtract actual cash. But here, we subtract 2% of revenue instead.\n\nSo for 2024:\n\nCurrent Assets - (2% of revenue) = 34,246 - 5,089.06 = 29,156.94\n\nCurrent Liabilities - Current Debt = 35,361\n\nOWC = 29,156.94 - 35,361 = -6,204.06\n\n2023:\n\nCurrent Assets - (2% of revenue) = 35,879 - 4,845.8 = 31,033.2\n\nCurrent Liabilities - Current Debt = 32,502\n\nOWC = 31,033.2 - 32,502 = -1,468.8\n\nChange = -6,204.06 - (-1,468.8) = -4,735.26\n\nSo the change is approximately -$4,735 million.\n\nBut let's check if the problem might have a typo and meant \"2% of revenue as the target for cash\", so they want to see the difference when cash is adjusted to 2% of revenue.\n\nGiven that, the answer should be a negative number, indicating a decrease in OWC.\n\nBut let's see if the numbers make sense. The actual cash decreased from $13,700 to $9,906, which is a decrease of $3,794 million. But the problem is not about cash, it's about OWC with a cap on cash.\n\nAnother check: The problem says \"max potential operating cash\", so they are capping the cash at 2% of revenue, meaning that if actual cash is higher than 2% of revenue, we use 2% instead. For 2024, actual cash is $9,906, which is higher than 2% of revenue ($5,089), so we use $5,089. For 2023, actual cash is $13,700, which is higher than 2% of revenue ($4,846), so we use $4,846.\n\nSo the calculation as done earlier is correct.\n\nThus, the change in OWC is approximately -$4,735 million. Rounding to the nearest million, it's -$4,735 million.\n\nBut let's compute the exact numbers.\n\n2024 revenue: 254,453\n\n2% of 254,453 = 5,089.06\n\n2023 revenue: 242,290\n\n2% of 242,290 = 4,845.8\n\nOWC 2024: (34,246 - 5,089.06) - (35,464 - 103) = 29,156.94 - 35,361 = -6,204.06\n\nOWC 2023: (35,879 - 4,845.8) - (33,583 - 1,081) = 31,033.2 - 32,502 = -1,468.8\n\nChange: -6,204.06 - (-1,468.8) = -4,735.26\n\nSo the answer is -$4,735 million.\n\nBut the problem says \"change in operating working capital\", which is typically reported as a positive number if it increased, but since it's negative, it's a decrease. However, the question doesn't specify absolute value, so the answer should be negative.\n\nIn financial terms, a negative change in OWC means that the company's operating working capital decreased, which is a use of cash, so it's a negative number.\n\nSo the final answer should be -$4,735 million.\n\nWait, but let's check if the problem might have a different definition. For example, sometimes OWC is defined as (Current Assets - Cash - Short-term Investments) - (Current Liabilities - Current Debt). Let's see.\n\nFor 2024:\n\nCurrent Assets: 34,246\n\nCash: 9,906\n\nShort-term investments: 1,238\n\nSo Current Assets - Cash - Short-term investments = 34,246 - 9,906 - 1,238 = 23,102\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 35,464\n\nCurrent Debt: 103\n\nOperating Current Liabilities = 35,464 - 103 = 35,361\n\nOWC = 23,102 - 35,361 = -12,259\n\nBut the problem says to use 2% of revenue as max operating cash. So if we adjust cash to 2% of revenue, but short-term investments are separate.\n\nWait, the problem says \"max potential operating cash\", which might refer to cash and cash equivalents, but not short-term investments. So perhaps we should adjust cash and short-term investments to 2% of revenue. But that seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"operating cash\" refers to cash used in operations, but the problem states \"max potential operating cash\", which is confusing.\n\nGiven the problem statement, the most straightforward interpretation is that they want to cap the cash component (cash and cash equivalents) at 2% of revenue, so instead of using the actual cash, use 2% of revenue.\n\nThus, the calculation as done earlier is correct.\n\nSo the change is approximately -$4,735 million.\n\nBut let's check the numbers again for accuracy.\n\n2024:\n\nRevenue: 254,453\n\n2%: 5,089.06\n\nCurrent Assets: 34,246\n\nAdjusted Current Assets: 34,246 - 5,089.06 = 29,156.94\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 35,464\n\nCurrent Debt: 103\n\nAdjusted Current Liabilities: 35,464 - 103 = 35,361\n\nOWC: 29,156.94 - 35,361 = -6,204.06\n\n2023:\n\nRevenue: 242,290\n\n2%: 4,845.8\n\nCurrent Assets: 35,879\n\nAdjusted Current Assets: 35,879 - 4,845.8 = 31,033.2\n\nCurrent Liabilities: 33,583\n\nCurrent Debt: 1,081\n\nAdjusted Current Liabilities: 33,583 - 1,081 = 32,502\n\nOWC: 31,033.2 - 32,502 = -1,468.8\n\nChange: -6,204.06 - (-1,468.8) = -4,735.26\n\nRounded to the nearest million, it's -$4,735 million.\n\nSo the final answer should be -4735 million, but in financial format, it's usually written as -$4,735 million or -4,735.\n\nBut the problem says \"concise, in the correct financial format\". So likely -$4,735 million.\n\nWait, but the numbers in the financial statements are in millions, so the answer should be in millions, so -$4,735.\n\nBut let's confirm the units. The context says \"amounts in millions\", so the answer should be in millions, so -4735.\n\nBut typically, it's written with commas: -$4,735.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"concise\", so maybe just -4735.\n\nBut looking at the example in the problem statement, they use numbers like $249,625, so with commas.\n\nSo the answer should be -$4,735.\n\nWait, but let's check if the problem might have a different approach. For example, maybe they want the change in OWC without the cash adjustment, but the problem specifically says to use 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash. So the adjustment is required.\n\nAnother possibility: \"max potential operating cash\" means that the company can have up to 2% of revenue in cash, so the excess cash is considered non-operating. So the operating cash is min(actual cash, 2% of revenue), and the rest is non-operating. But in the calculation of OWC, we use the operating cash, so we subtract the operating cash (which is capped at 2% of revenue) from current assets.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nSo I think the calculation is correct.\n\nThus, the change in operating working capital is -$4,735 million.\n</think>\n\n<answer>-$4,735</answer>",

      "question": "Compute UFCF (Unlevered Free Cash Flow) for 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "$4,664 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to compute the UFCF (Unlevered Free Cash Flow) for Costco for 2024. Let me recall what UFCF is. Unlevered Free Cash Flow is the cash flow available to all investors before considering debt, so it's typically calculated as Operating Cash Flow minus Capital Expenditures. But I should confirm the exact formula.\n\nLooking at the financial statements provided, I see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For 2024, the \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" is $11,339 million. Then, for investing activities, \"Additions to property and equipment\" is $4,710 million, which is the capital expenditure (CapEx) for the year.\n\nUFCF is usually calculated as:\nUFCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\nOperating Cash Flow (2024) = $11,339 million\nCapEx (2024) = $4,710 million\n\nTherefore, UFCF = 11,339 - 4,710 = $6,629 million.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any other adjustments. Sometimes UFCF might include changes in working capital, but the standard formula is operating cash flow minus CapEx. The operating cash flow already accounts for changes in working capital, so subtracting CapEx should give the unlevered free cash flow.\n\nLet me verify the numbers from the cash flow statement:\n- Net cash provided by operating activities: $11,339 million\n- Additions to property and equipment (CapEx): $4,710 million\n\nYes, that's correct. So UFCF = 11,339 - 4,710 = 6,629.\n\nI should also check if there are any other items that might affect this. For example, sometimes companies adjust for non-cash items, but in this case, the operating cash flow already reconciles net income to cash flow, so it's already adjusted for non-cash items like depreciation. So subtracting CapEx should be the right approach.\n\nAnother way to think about UFCF is EBIT(1 - tax rate) + Depreciation - CapEx - Change in Working Capital. But since the cash flow statement already gives operating cash flow, which includes all those adjustments, using the operating cash flow minus CapEx is the standard method.\n\nLooking at the cash flow statement, the operating cash flow is $11,339, and CapEx is $4,710. So the calculation should be straightforward.\n\nLet me double-check the numbers from the provided data:\n- \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" for 2024: $11,339 million\n- \"Additions to property and equipment\" for 2024: $4,710 million\n\nYes, that's correct. So UFCF = 11,339 - 4,710 = 6,629.\n\nI think that's it. The answer should be $6,629 million. But let me make sure about the units. The financial statements are in millions, so the answer should be in millions as well. The question says \"compute UFCF for 2024,\" and the context shows amounts in millions, so the answer should be $6,629 million.\n\nWait, but sometimes UFCF is presented without the \"million\" in the answer, but since the question specifies \"in the correct financial format,\" and the context uses millions, I should probably write it as 6,629 (implying millions) or $6,629 million. But looking at the instructions, it says \"concise, in the correct financial format.\" In financial contexts, UFCF is often reported in millions, so $6,629 million is standard.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other adjustment. For example, sometimes companies subtract changes in working capital, but the operating cash flow already includes that. The operating cash flow is after all working capital changes, so subtracting CapEx is correct.\n\nAnother point: the cash flow statement shows \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" as $11,339, which includes all the adjustments. So yes, subtracting CapEx gives the unlevered free cash flow.\n\nI think I'm confident with this calculation. So the UFCF for 2024 is $6,629 million.\n</think>\n\nTo compute UFCF (Unlevered Free Cash Flow) for 2024, the formula used is:  \n**UFCF = Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures (CapEx)**  \n\nFrom the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (2024):  \n- Net cash provided by operating activities = **$11,339 million**  \n- Additions to property and equipment (CapEx) = **$4,710 million**  \n\nThus:  \nUFCF = $11,339 million - $4,710 million = **$6,629 million**  \n\n<answer>:6,629",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to calculate the levered free cash flow for Costco in 2024. Let me recall what levered free cash flow means. It's the cash flow available to all investors after debt payments, but typically it's calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Wait, no—levered free cash flow is usually the cash flow after debt obligations, but in many contexts, it's the same as free cash flow to equity, which is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures minus debt repayments. But I should check the standard formula.\n\nWait, actually, levered free cash flow (LFCF) is often defined as:\n\nLFCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures - Debt Repayments + New Debt Issuance\n\nBut sometimes it's simplified to Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures, especially if debt repayments and issuances are small. However, in the context of financial statements, the standard free cash flow (unlevered) is Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures. But the question specifies \"levered,\" so I need to account for debt.\n\nLooking at Costco's cash flow statement, I see:\n\n- Net cash provided by operating activities: $11,339 million (for 2024)\n- Net cash used in investing activities: ($4,409) million, which includes capital expenditures (additions to property and equipment) of $4,710 million.\n\nWait, the investing activities section shows \"Additions to property and equipment\" as ($4,710) million. So capital expenditures (CapEx) are $4,710 million.\n\nFor levered free cash flow, it's typically Operating Cash Flow minus CapEx minus Net Debt Repayments. But let's see what the cash flow statement shows for financing activities.\n\nIn financing activities, there are items like:\n- Repayments of long-term debt: ($1,077) million\n- Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt: $498 million\n- Repayments of short-term borrowings: ($920) million\n- Proceeds from short-term borrowings: $928 million\n\nSo net debt repayments would be (Repayments - Proceeds). For long-term debt: ($1,077) + $498 = ($579) million net repayment. For short-term: ($920) + $928 = $8 million net proceeds. So total net debt repayment is ($579) + $8 = ($571) million. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to calculate it.\n\nWait, the standard formula for levered free cash flow is:\n\nLFCF = Operating Cash Flow - CapEx - Net Debt Repayments\n\nBut sometimes it's presented as:\n\nLFCF = Net Cash from Operations - CapEx - Net Debt Repayments\n\nBut in many cases, especially in financial analysis, levered free cash flow is simply the cash flow available to equity holders after debt payments, which would be:\n\nLFCF = Operating Cash Flow - CapEx - Interest Paid + Net Borrowing\n\nBut I need to be careful. Let me check the cash flow statement.\n\nFrom the cash flow statement:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities: $11,339 million\n\nNet cash used in investing activities: ($4,409) million, which includes CapEx of $4,710 million (since \"Additions to property and equipment\" is ($4,710) million, and other investing activities are small).\n\nSo, the free cash flow (unlevered) would be Operating Cash Flow - CapEx = $11,339 - $4,710 = $6,629 million.\n\nBut the question asks for levered free cash flow. Levered means after debt obligations. So, we need to subtract the net debt repayments.\n\nFrom financing activities:\n\n- Repayments of long-term debt: ($1,077)\n- Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt: $498\n- Repayments of short-term borrowings: ($920)\n- Proceeds from short-term borrowings: $928\n\nSo, net debt repayment = (Repayments - Proceeds) = [($1,077) + ($920)] - [$498 + $928] = ($1,997) - ($1,426) = ($571) million. So net debt repayment is $571 million.\n\nTherefore, levered free cash flow = Operating Cash Flow - CapEx - Net Debt Repayment = $11,339 - $4,710 - $571 = $6,058 million.\n\nWait, but is that the correct formula? Let me confirm.\n\nAnother way: Levered free cash flow is the cash flow available to equity holders after all obligations, including debt. So it's the cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus debt repayments (since debt repayments reduce cash available to equity).\n\nYes, so:\n\nLFCF = CFO - CapEx - Net Debt Repayments\n\nWhere Net Debt Repayments = Total Debt Repaid - New Debt Issued.\n\nIn this case, total debt repaid (long-term + short-term) is $1,077 + $920 = $1,997 million.\n\nNew debt issued (long-term + short-term) is $498 + $928 = $1,426 million.\n\nSo net debt repayment = $1,997 - $1,426 = $571 million.\n\nThus, LFCF = $11,339 - $4,710 - $571 = $6,058 million.\n\nBut let me check if there's a standard way. Sometimes, levered free cash flow is just CFO - CapEx, and unlevered is the same. But the question specifies \"levered,\" so I think we need to adjust for debt.\n\nWait, looking at the cash flow statement, the \"Net cash used in financing activities\" is ($10,764) million. But that's a large number because it includes dividends and stock repurchases.\n\nBut for levered free cash flow, it's typically the cash flow after debt payments, so we need to subtract the net debt repayment.\n\nAlternatively, some sources define levered free cash flow as:\n\nLFCF = Net Income + Depreciation - Changes in Working Capital - CapEx - Debt Repayments\n\nBut that might not be standard. The most common definition is CFO - CapEx - Net Debt Repayments.\n\nLet me verify with the cash flow statement.\n\nThe cash flow from operations is $11,339 million.\n\nCapEx is $4,710 million (from investing activities).\n\nNet debt repayment is $571 million (as calculated).\n\nSo LFCF = 11,339 - 4,710 - 571 = 6,058 million.\n\nBut let's check if the cash flow statement has a line for \"Free Cash Flow\" or something similar. The statement doesn't explicitly say, but the standard calculation is CFO - CapEx.\n\nHowever, the question says \"levered,\" so we need to adjust for debt.\n\nAnother way: Levered free cash flow is the cash flow available to equity holders, which would be:\n\nCFO - CapEx - Interest Paid + Net Borrowing\n\nBut interest paid is included in operating cash flow. Wait, in the cash flow statement, interest paid is part of operating activities? No, interest paid is usually in operating activities, but in the supplemental disclosure, it says \"Cash paid during the year for: Interest $129 million.\"\n\nSo interest paid is $129 million, but that's already included in the operating cash flow.\n\nWait, the operating cash flow is after interest paid, so it's already accounted for.\n\nSo, the correct formula for levered free cash flow should be:\n\nLFCF = Operating Cash Flow - CapEx - Net Debt Repayments\n\nBecause net debt repayments are a financing activity that reduces cash available to equity.\n\nSo, using the numbers:\n\nOperating Cash Flow: $11,339 million\n\nCapEx: $4,710 million\n\nNet Debt Repayments: $571 million\n\nLFCF = 11,339 - 4,710 - 571 = 6,058 million.\n\nBut let me double-check the net debt repayment.\n\nFrom financing activities:\n\n- Repayments of long-term debt: ($1,077)\n- Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt: $498\n- Repayments of short-term borrowings: ($920)\n- Proceeds from short-term borrowings: $928\n\nSo, net long-term debt: ($1,077) + $498 = ($579) million (net repayment)\n\nNet short-term debt: ($920) + $928 = $8 million (net proceeds)\n\nTotal net debt repayment: ($579) + $8 = ($571) million. So yes, net repayment of $571 million.\n\nTherefore, LFCF = 11,339 - 4,710 - 571 = 6,058.\n\nBut let's calculate it step by step:\n\n11,339 - 4,710 = 6,629\n\n6,629 - 571 = 6,058.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is there any other adjustment? For example, the cash flow statement shows \"Financing lease payments and other financing activities, net\" as ($137) million. But that's part of financing activities, and it's already included in the net cash used in financing activities. However, for levered free cash flow, we're focusing on debt repayments, which are separate from lease payments. Lease payments are part of operating or financing activities, but in this case, the lease payments are included in the financing activities as \"Financing lease payments and other financing activities, net\" of ($137) million. But I think the main debt repayments are the long-term and short-term borrowings.\n\nThe lease payments are separate from the debt repayments. The debt repayments are for the long-term debt and short-term borrowings, which we've accounted for.\n\nSo, I think $6,058 million is the correct levered free cash flow.\n\nBut let me check if the question might be expecting just CFO - CapEx, which is unlevered. But the question specifically says \"levered,\" so we need to adjust for debt.\n\nAnother way to think: Levered free cash flow is the cash flow available to equity holders after all obligations, including debt. So, after paying off debt, the remaining cash is available to equity holders. So, yes, subtracting net debt repayments makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $6,058 million.\n\nWait, but let's check the numbers again.\n\nOperating cash flow: $11,339 million\n\nCapEx: $4,710 million\n\nNet debt repayment: $571 million\n\n11,339 - 4,710 = 6,629\n\n6,629 - 571 = 6,058.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the question says \"Calculate levered free cash flow for 2024.\" So the answer is $6,058 million.\n\nBut let's make sure about the units. The financial statements are in millions, so it's $6,058 million.\n\nIn the context, the answer should be in the format like $6,058 million, but the instruction says \"concise, in the correct financial format.\" So probably just the number with commas, but since it's millions, maybe just the number.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" So likely $6,058 million, but since it's a number, perhaps just 6058 with the understanding it's in millions.\n\nBut looking at the financial statements, all numbers are in millions, so the answer should be 6058 (implying millions).\n\nBut to be precise, in financial contexts, it's common to say $6,058 million.\n\nHowever, the instruction says \"concise,\" so probably just the number with commas as in the statements.\n\nLooking at the statements, they use numbers like $249,625, so the answer should be $6,058.\n\nWait, but the question says \"in the correct financial format,\" so likely $6,058 million, but since it's a number, perhaps just 6,058.\n\nBut in the context of the problem, the answer should be presented as a number with commas, like the statements.\n\nSo, the final answer is $6,058 million, but since the question might expect just the number in millions, it's 6,058.\n\nWait, but in the cash flow statement, it's \"11,339\" for operating cash flow, which is in millions, so the answer should be 6,058.\n\nSo, the final answer is 6,058.\n\nBut let me confirm once more.\n\nOperating cash flow: 11,339\n\nCapEx: 4,710\n\nNet debt repayment: 571\n\n11,339 - 4,710 = 6,629\n\n6,629 - 571 = 6,058.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate levered free cash flow (LFCF) for 2024, use the formula:  \n**LFCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures - Net Debt Repayments**  \n\nFrom Costco's 2024 cash flow statement:  \n- **Operating Cash Flow**: $11,339 million  \n- **Capital Expenditures (Additions to Property & Equipment)**: $4,710 million  \n- **Net Debt Repayments**:  \n  - Long-term debt repayments: $1,077 million  \n  - Long-term debt proceeds: $498 million  \n  - Short-term debt repayments: $920 million  \n  - Short-term debt proceeds: $928 million  \n  - **Net Debt Repayment** = ($1,077 + $920) - ($498 + $928) = $571 million  \n\n**Calculation**:  \nLFCF = $11,339 - $4,710 - $571 = **$6,058 million**  \n\n<answer>:6,058",

      "question": "Calculate Accounts Receivables Days for 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "3.59x",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is to calculate Accounts Receivables Days for 2024. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for Accounts Receivables Days. It's usually (Accounts Receivable / Net Credit Sales) * 365. But wait, the problem doesn't specify if the sales are credit sales. However, in many cases, especially for companies like Costco, which is a retail company, most sales are probably cash-based, but they might have some credit sales. But looking at the financial statements provided, I need to check if there's any mention of credit sales.\n\nLooking at the Consolidated Statements of Income, the revenue is broken down into Net sales and Membership fees. But the problem is about Accounts Receivables, which would be related to credit sales. However, Costco is a membership warehouse club, so they typically operate on a cash basis for most transactions. But they might have some receivables from members or other sources.\n\nWait, the Consolidated Balance Sheets show \"Receivables, net\" as $2,721 million as of September 1, 2024. So that's the accounts receivable figure. Now, for the numerator, we need the credit sales. But the problem is, the income statement shows \"Net sales\" as $249,625 million for 2024. But are all net sales credit sales? Probably not. However, in the absence of specific credit sales data, the standard practice is to use total net sales as the denominator for accounts receivable days calculation. Because if they don't separate cash and credit sales, we assume all sales are credit for this purpose. Wait, but that's not accurate. However, in many financial ratios, especially when credit sales aren't specified, they use total sales.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The formula for Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is (Accounts Receivable / Annual Credit Sales) * 365. But if credit sales aren't available, sometimes total sales are used. But Costco might have a different structure. Let me check the financials again.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, \"Receivables, net\" is $2,721 million as of September 1, 2024. The income statement shows Net sales of $249,625 million for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024. \n\nAssuming that all sales are on credit (which might not be true, but without more data, this is the standard approach), the calculation would be (2,721 / 249,625) * 365. \n\nWait, but let's check if there's any other information. The problem mentions \"Accounts Receivables Days,\" which is the same as Days Sales Outstanding (DSO). So the formula is (Receivables / Net Credit Sales) * 365. Since credit sales aren't specified, we'll use total net sales as a proxy.\n\nSo, Receivables = $2,721 million (from the balance sheet, September 1, 2024)\n\nNet Sales = $249,625 million (from the income statement for 2024)\n\nSo DSO = (2,721 / 249,625) * 365\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 2,721 divided by 249,625. Let's calculate that.\n\n2,721 / 249,625 ≈ 0.0109\n\nThen multiply by 365: 0.0109 * 365 ≈ 3.98\n\nSo approximately 4 days.\n\nWait, that seems very low. Is that possible? Costco is a retail company, and they usually have very low receivables because they operate on a cash basis. For example, members pay at the time of purchase, so receivables would be minimal. So 4 days makes sense.\n\nWait, but let's check the previous year to see if it's consistent. For 2023, Receivables were $2,285 million. Net sales were $237,710 million.\n\nDSO for 2023: (2,285 / 237,710) * 365 ≈ (0.00961) * 365 ≈ 3.5 days. So it's increasing from 3.5 to 4 days, which makes sense as receivables increased from 2,285 to 2,721, while sales increased from 237k to 249k.\n\nSo the calculation for 2024 is (2,721 / 249,625) * 365.\n\nLet me do the exact calculation.\n\n2,721 ÷ 249,625 = 0.010900\n\n0.010900 * 365 = 3.9785, which rounds to 4 days.\n\nSo the answer should be 4 days.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if the receivables are for the year-end. The balance sheet is as of September 1, 2024, which is the end of the fiscal year. So the receivables figure is the average or the year-end? For DSO, it's usually (Average Receivables / Net Credit Sales) * 365. But if we don't have the average, we use the year-end figure as a proxy. The problem doesn't provide the prior year's receivables for average, so we'll use the ending receivables.\n\nSo using ending receivables of $2,721 million.\n\nYes, so the calculation is correct. So the Accounts Receivables Days for 2024 is 4 days.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate Accounts Receivables Days for 2024, use the formula:  \n**(Accounts Receivable / Net Sales) × 365**  \n\nFrom the provided financial statements:  \n- **Accounts Receivable (net)** as of September 1, 2024: **$2,721 million**  \n- **Net Sales** for 2024: **$249,625 million**  \n\nCalculation:  \n(2,721 / 249,625) × 365 ≈ 3.98 → **4 days**  \n\n<answer>:4",

      "ground_truth": "30.29x",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to calculate the Accounts Payables Days for Costco for 2024. Let me recall what Accounts Payables Days represents. It's a measure of how long a company takes to pay its suppliers, calculated as (Accounts Payable / Cost of Goods Sold) * 365.\n\nFirst, I need to find the Accounts Payable and the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for 2024. Looking at the financial statements provided.\n\nFrom the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the Accounts Payable for 2024 (September 1, 2024) is $19,421 million.\n\nNow, for COGS. The Consolidated Statements of Income shows Merchandise Costs as $222,358 million for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024. Merchandise Costs is the same as COGS in this context.\n\nSo, Accounts Payable = $19,421 million\nCOGS = $222,358 million\n\nThe formula for Accounts Payables Days is:\n( (Accounts Payable) / (COGS) ) * 365\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n(19,421 / 222,358) * 365\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 19,421 divided by 222,358 equals approximately 0.0873.\n\nThen, 0.0873 * 365 ≈ 31.86 days.\n\nSo, Accounts Payables Days for 2024 is approximately 32 days.\n\nWait, let me double-check the numbers to be sure.\n\nAccounts Payable: $19,421 million (from Balance Sheet, September 1, 2024)\nCOGS: $222,358 million (from Income Statement, 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024)\n\nYes, that's correct. Merchandise Costs is the COGS.\n\nCalculating again:\n19,421 / 222,358 = 0.08734\n0.08734 * 365 = 31.87 days, which rounds to 32 days.\n\nI should confirm if there's any need to use average Accounts Payable. Typically, for this ratio, if you have the beginning and ending balances, you use the average. But in this case, the problem only gives the ending balance for 2024 (September 1, 2024), and the beginning balance would be for September 3, 2023, which is $17,483 million.\n\nSo, average Accounts Payable = (19,421 + 17,483) / 2 = 36,904 / 2 = 18,452 million.\n\nThen, Accounts Payables Days = (18,452 / 222,358) * 365.\n\nCalculating that:\n18,452 / 222,358 ≈ 0.0830\n0.0830 * 365 ≈ 30.3 days, which would round to 30 days.\n\nHmm, this is a point of confusion. Which method is standard? In many cases, especially when only the ending balance is provided, companies use the ending balance. But the more accurate method is to use the average of beginning and ending balances.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"Calculate Accounts Payables Days for 2024.\" The context provides both the ending balance for 2024 and the beginning balance for 2023 (which is the ending balance for 2023).\n\nIn financial analysis, the standard practice is to use the average accounts payable for the year. So I should use the average.\n\nLet me verify with the numbers:\n\nBeginning Accounts Payable (Sept 3, 2023): $17,483 million\nEnding Accounts Payable (Sept 1, 2024): $19,421 million\nAverage = (17,483 + 19,421) / 2 = 36,904 / 2 = 18,452 million\n\nCOGS = $222,358 million\n\nAccounts Payables Days = (18,452 / 222,358) * 365\n\nCalculating:\n18,452 / 222,358 = 0.0830\n0.0830 * 365 = 30.295 days ≈ 30 days\n\nSo, the correct calculation should use the average, resulting in approximately 30 days.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by using only the ending balance. The standard formula uses the average accounts payable.\n\nLet me confirm with a reliable source. Yes, in financial ratios, Accounts Payable Days is typically calculated using the average accounts payable balance over the period.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation is:\n\n( (Beginning AP + Ending AP) / 2 ) / COGS * 365\n\nSo, ( (17,483 + 19,421) / 2 ) / 222,358 * 365\n= (36,904 / 2) / 222,358 * 365\n= 18,452 / 222,358 * 365\n= 0.0830 * 365\n= 30.295 ≈ 30 days\n\nSo, the answer should be 30 days.\n\nWait, but let me check if the COGS is correct. The Income Statement shows Merchandise Costs as $222,358 million, which is the COGS. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to note: sometimes companies use the cost of sales, which is the same as COGS. So Merchandise Costs is the right figure.\n\nTherefore, the Accounts Payables Days for 2024 is 30 days.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate Accounts Payables Days for 2024, use the formula:  \n( (Beginning Accounts Payable + Ending Accounts Payable) / 2 ) / Cost of Goods Sold × 365  \n\nFrom the financial statements:  \n- Ending Accounts Payable (Sept 1, 2024): $19,421 million  \n- Beginning Accounts Payable (Sept 3, 2023): $17,483 million  \n- Cost of Goods Sold (Merchandise Costs, 52 Weeks Ended Sept 1, 2024): $222,358 million  \n\nCalculate average Accounts Payable:  \n(19,421 + 17,483) / 2 = 18,452 million  \n\nCalculate Accounts Payables Days:  \n(18,452 / 222,358) × 365 ≈ 30.3 days → **30 days** (rounded to nearest whole number)  \n\n<answer>:30",

Looking at the Consolidated Statements of Income, under Operating Expenses, Merchandise costs are listed as $222,358 million for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024. That should be the COGS.\n\nNext, I need the average inventory. Inventory is listed under Current Assets as Merchandise inventories. For 2024, it's $18,647 million as of September 1, 2024. For 2023, it's $16,651 million as of September 3, 2023. Since the balance sheet is dated September 1, 2024, and September 3, 2023, I'll use those as the beginning and ending inventory for the year.\n\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\n= ($16,651 + $18,647) / 2\n= $35,298 / 2\n= $17,649 million\n\nNow, Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory\n= $222,358 / $17,649\nLet me calculate that.\n\n222,358 ÷ 17,649 ≈ 12.6\n\nWait, let me do the division properly.\n\n17,649 × 12 = 211,788\n222,358 - 211,788 = 10,570\n10,570 / 17,649 ≈ 0.599\nSo total is approximately 12.6\n\nBut let me check with exact numbers.\n\n222,358 ÷ 17,649 = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n17,649 × 12.6 = 17,649 × 12 + 17,649 × 0.6\n= 211,788 + 10,589.4 = 222,377.4\n\nThat's very close to 222,358, so approximately 12.6.\n\nBut let me confirm the numbers again.\n\nCOGS: $222,358 million (from Merchandise costs)\nEnding Inventory (2024): $18,647 million\nBeginning Inventory (2023): $16,651 million\n\nAverage Inventory = (16,651 + 18,647) / 2 = 35,298 / 2 = 17,649 million\n\nInventory Turnover = 222,358 / 17,649 ≈ 12.60\n\nSo the Inventory Turnover for 2024 is approximately 12.6 times.\n\nI should check if there's any other information that might affect this. The problem doesn't mention any adjustments, so I think this is straightforward.\n\nAlso, the question asks for the final answer in the correct financial format. Typically, Inventory Turnover is reported as a number, often rounded to one decimal place.\n\nSo the answer should be 12.6.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. The Merchandise costs are indeed the COGS. Yes, in the income statement, Merchandise costs are the cost of goods sold.\n\nAlso, the inventory values are correct from the balance sheet.\n\nAnother thing to check: the time period. The income statement is for 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, and the balance sheet as of September 1, 2024, and September 3, 2023. So the beginning inventory is as of the end of the previous year, which is correct for the average.\n\nYes, this seems right.\n\nSo the Inventory Turnover for 2024 is 12.6.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate Inventory Turnover for 2024, use the formula:  \n**Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory**  \n\n- **COGS** (from Consolidated Statements of Income): Merchandise costs = **$222,358 million** (52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024).  \n- **Ending Inventory (2024)**: Merchandise inventories = **$18,647 million** (as of September 1, 2024).  \n- **Beginning Inventory (2023)**: Merchandise inventories = **$16,651 million** (as of September 3, 2023).  \n- **Average Inventory** = ($16,651 + $18,647) / 2 = **$17,649 million**.  \n\n**Inventory Turnover** = $222,358 / $17,649 ≈ **12.6**.  \n\n<answer>:12.6",

      "question": "Determine the EV/Sales ratio for 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "1.67x",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this EV/Sales ratio question for Costco in 2024. First, I need to recall what EV/Sales stands for. EV is Enterprise Value, which is typically calculated as Market Capitalization plus Debt minus Cash. Sales would be the total revenue.\n\nLooking at the provided financial statements, I need to find the necessary components. The question is for 2024, so I'll focus on the September 1, 2024, balance sheet and income statement.\n\nFirst, Market Capitalization. The problem states \"Costco Stock Price: $940\" and the shares outstanding. From the Consolidated Statements of Equity, under \"BALANCE AT SEPTEMBER 1, 2024\", the common stock shares issued and outstanding are 443,126,000 shares. So Market Cap = Stock Price × Shares Outstanding = $940 × 443,126,000.\n\nWait, but the shares are in thousands? Let me check. The \"Shares used in calculation (000’s)\" for basic shares is 443,914,000. Wait, no, the balance sheet shows \"Common stock $0.005 par value; 900,000,000 shares authorized; 443,126,000 and 442,793,000 shares issued and outstanding\". So 443,126,000 shares. So Market Cap = 443,126,000 × $940.\n\nBut let me confirm the exact number. The balance sheet says 443,126,000 shares issued and outstanding. So yes, 443.126 million shares.\n\nNext, Debt. From the balance sheet, total liabilities include current and long-term debt. The \"Total Liabilities\" are $46,209 million. But Debt specifically would be the long-term debt plus current portion. Looking at the balance sheet, \"Current portion of long-term debt\" is $103 million, and \"Long-term debt, excluding current portion\" is $5,794 million. So total debt = $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Costco Stock Price: $940\" and \"Cost of Debt: 6%\", but for EV, we need the market value of debt. However, the problem states \"Assume Market Return is 11%\", but for EV/Sales, we usually use the book value of debt unless specified otherwise. The problem doesn't mention market value of debt, so I'll use the book value.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents: From the balance sheet, \"Cash and cash equivalents\" as of September 1, 2024, is $9,906 million.\n\nSo Enterprise Value (EV) = Market Cap + Debt - Cash.\n\nCalculating Market Cap: 443,126,000 shares × $940/share. Let's compute that. 443,126,000 × 940 = 443,126 × 940 × 1,000. 443,126 × 940 = let's see, 443,126 × 900 = 398,813,400; 443,126 × 40 = 17,725,040; total 416,538,440. So $416,538,440,000 or $416.538 billion. Wait, but the shares are in thousands? Wait, no, the shares are 443,126,000, which is 443.126 million. So 443.126 million × $940 = $416,538.44 million. So approximately $416,538 million.\n\nDebt: Current portion of long-term debt is $103 million, long-term debt excluding current portion is $5,794 million. So total debt = $103 + $5,794 = $5,897 million.\n\nCash: $9,906 million.\n\nSo EV = $416,538 + $5,897 - $9,906 = $416,538 + $5,897 = $422,435; $422,435 - $9,906 = $412,529 million.\n\nNow, Sales: From the income statement, \"Total revenue\" for 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, is $254,453 million. Wait, the income statement shows \"Total revenue\" as $254,453 million. So Sales = $254,453 million.\n\nEV/Sales = EV / Sales = $412,529 / $254,453 ≈ 1.62.\n\nWait, let me check the numbers again.\n\nMarket Cap: 443,126,000 shares × $940 = 443,126,000 × 940.\n\n443,126,000 × 900 = 398,813,400,000\n\n443,126,000 × 40 = 17,725,040,000\n\nTotal = 416,538,440,000 → $416,538.44 million.\n\nDebt: $5,897 million.\n\nCash: $9,906 million.\n\nEV = 416,538.44 + 5,897 - 9,906 = 416,538.44 + 5,897 = 422,435.44; 422,435.44 - 9,906 = 412,529.44 million.\n\nSales: $254,453 million.\n\nEV/Sales = 412,529.44 / 254,453 ≈ 1.621.\n\nSo approximately 1.62.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if \"Total revenue\" is the correct sales figure. The income statement shows \"Total revenue\" as $254,453 million, which includes net sales and membership fees. But for EV/Sales, typically, we use total revenue as the sales figure. The problem says \"Determine the EV/Sales ratio\", so Sales here refers to total revenue.\n\nYes, in financial ratios, EV/Sales uses total revenue, not just net sales. So Total revenue is $254,453 million.\n\nSo the calculation seems correct. Let me check if there's any other component I missed.\n\nThe problem also mentions \"Beta: 0.79\", \"Cost of Debt: 6%\", \"10Y Treasury: 4.617%\", \"Assume Market Return is 11%\". But for EV/Sales, these are not needed. EV/Sales is a simple ratio of Enterprise Value to Sales, so those inputs are probably red herrings for this question.\n\nSo the final answer should be approximately 1.62.\n\nWait, let me check the exact numbers again.\n\nMarket Cap: 443,126,000 shares × $940 = 443,126,000 × 940.\n\n443,126,000 × 940 = 443,126 × 940 × 1,000.\n\n443,126 × 940:\n\nCalculate 443,126 × 900 = 398,813,400\n\n443,126 × 40 = 17,725,040\n\nTotal = 398,813,400 + 17,725,040 = 416,538,440\n\nSo 416,538,440 × 1,000 = 416,538,440,000 → $416,538.44 million.\n\nDebt: Current portion $103 + Long-term $5,794 = $5,897 million.\n\nCash: $9,906 million.\n\nEV = 416,538.44 + 5,897 - 9,906 = 416,538.44 + 5,897 = 422,435.44; 422,435.44 - 9,906 = 412,529.44 million.\n\nSales: $254,453 million.\n\nEV/Sales = 412,529.44 / 254,453 ≈ 1.621.\n\nRounded to two decimal places, 1.62.\n\nSo the answer should be 1.62.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the EV/Sales ratio for 2024, calculate Enterprise Value (EV) as Market Capitalization + Debt - Cash, then divide by Total Revenue.\n\n- **Market Capitalization**:  \n  Shares outstanding (443,126,000) × Stock Price ($940) = $416,538.44 million.\n\n- **Debt**:  \n  Current portion of long-term debt ($103 million) + Long-term debt ($5,794 million) = $5,897 million.\n\n- **Cash**:  \n  Cash and cash equivalents ($9,906 million).\n\n- **EV**:  \n  $416,538.44 + $5,897 - $9,906 = $412,529.44 million.\n\n- **Total Revenue (Sales)**:  \n  $254,453 million (from Consolidated Statements of Income).\n\n- **EV/Sales**:  \n  $412,529.44 / $254,453 ≈ 1.62.\n\n<answer>:1.62",

      "question": "Calculate Asset Turnover for 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "3.67x",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, I need to calculate the Asset Turnover for Costco for 2024. Let me recall what Asset Turnover is. It's a financial ratio that measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate sales. The formula is:\n\nAsset Turnover = Net Sales / Average Total Assets\n\nFirst, I need to find the Net Sales for 2024. Looking at the Consolidated Statements of Income, under Revenue, Total Revenue is $254,453 million. But wait, the question says \"Net Sales,\" which is listed as $249,625 million. I should confirm that. Yes, in the income statement, \"Net sales\" is $249,625 million for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024. So Net Sales = $249,625 million.\n\nNext, I need the Average Total Assets for 2024. Average Total Assets is calculated as (Total Assets at the end of 2024 + Total Assets at the end of 2023) / 2.\n\nFrom the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Total Assets as of September 1, 2024 (end of 2024) is $69,831 million. Total Assets as of September 3, 2023 (end of 2023) is $68,994 million.\n\nSo, Average Total Assets = ($69,831 + $68,994) / 2 = $138,825 / 2 = $69,412.5 million.\n\nNow, Asset Turnover = Net Sales / Average Total Assets = $249,625 / $69,412.5.\n\nLet me calculate that. 249,625 ÷ 69,412.5 ≈ 3.595.\n\nI should check if the question specifies rounding. Typically, financial ratios are reported to two decimal places. So 3.60.\n\nWait, let me verify the numbers again to be sure.\n\nNet Sales: $249,625 million (from income statement, \"Net sales\" line).\n\nTotal Assets 2024: $69,831 million (from balance sheet, \"TOTAL ASSETS\" line).\n\nTotal Assets 2023: $68,994 million.\n\nAverage = (69,831 + 68,994) / 2 = 138,825 / 2 = 69,412.5.\n\nAsset Turnover = 249,625 / 69,412.5 ≈ 3.595, which rounds to 3.60.\n\nI should confirm if there's any other consideration. Sometimes, for asset turnover, people use total revenue instead of net sales, but the question says \"Asset Turnover,\" which typically uses net sales. The income statement shows \"Net sales\" as $249,625, and \"Total revenue\" as $254,453 (which includes membership fees). But asset turnover is usually based on net sales, not total revenue. So I think using $249,625 is correct.\n\nAlso, checking the balance sheet, the assets are in millions, so the calculation should be fine.\n\nSo, 249,625 / 69,412.5 = let's do the division precisely.\n\n249,625 ÷ 69,412.5 = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n69,412.5 × 3.6 = 69,412.5 × 3 + 69,412.5 × 0.6 = 208,237.5 + 41,647.5 = 249,885. That's a bit higher than 249,625.\n\nSo 249,625 / 69,412.5 ≈ 3.595, which is approximately 3.60 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nYes, so the Asset Turnover for 2024 is 3.60.\n\nI think that's it. The key points are using the correct net sales figure and the average of the two years' total assets.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate Asset Turnover for 2024, use the formula:  \n**Asset Turnover = Net Sales / Average Total Assets**  \n\n- **Net Sales (2024)**: $249,625 million (from Consolidated Statements of Income, \"Net sales\" line).  \n- **Total Assets (2024)**: $69,831 million (from Consolidated Balance Sheets, \"TOTAL ASSETS\" line).  \n- **Total Assets (2023)**: $68,994 million (from Consolidated Balance Sheets, \"TOTAL ASSETS\" line).  \n- **Average Total Assets** = ($69,831 + $68,994) / 2 = $69,412.5 million.  \n\n**Asset Turnover** = $249,625 / $69,412.5 ≈ **3.60** (rounded to two decimal places).  \n\n<answer>:3.60",

      "question": "What was Sales per store in 2024?",
      "ground_truth": "$285.90",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: \"What was Sales per store in 2024?\" \n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant data from the provided financial statements. The question is about sales per store, so I should look for total sales and the number of stores.\n\nLooking at the original context, there's a section titled \"COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION\" with financial statements. The Consolidated Statements of Income show \"Net sales\" as $249,625 million for the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024. That's the total revenue from sales.\n\nNext, I need the number of stores. The \"Item 2—Properties\" section mentions \"Warehouse Properties\" and states: \"At September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses.\" So, the total number of stores is 890.\n\nNow, to calculate sales per store, I divide total net sales by the number of stores. So, $249,625 million divided by 890 stores.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 249,625 / 890. Let me compute that. 249,625 ÷ 890. Let's see, 890 times 280 is 249,200. So 249,625 - 249,200 = 425. So 280 + (425/890) ≈ 280 + 0.477 ≈ 280.477. So approximately $280.48 million per store.\n\nWait, but the numbers are in millions, so the answer should be in millions per store. The question asks for \"Sales per store,\" so the answer should be the total sales divided by the number of stores, expressed in millions.\n\nDouble-checking the numbers: Net sales are $249,625 million, stores are 890. So 249,625 / 890 = let's calculate it more precisely.\n\n249,625 ÷ 890. Let's divide both by 5: 49,925 / 178. Hmm, maybe better to use a calculator approach. 890 × 280 = 249,200. 249,625 - 249,200 = 425. So 425 / 890 = 0.4775. So total is 280.4775 million. Rounding to two decimal places, it's $280.48 million per store.\n\nWait, but the problem might expect it in a specific format. The answer should be in the correct financial format, so probably rounded to two decimal places, as is standard for financial figures.\n\nAlso, check if there's any other data that might affect this. The Membership section mentions \"Total paid members\" but that's not relevant for sales per store. The warehouse count is clearly 890 as per Item 2.\n\nSo, the calculation is correct: 249,625 / 890 ≈ 280.48 million per store.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the exact number. Let's do 249625 divided by 890.\n\n249625 ÷ 890:\n\n890 × 280 = 249,200\n\n249,625 - 249,200 = 425\n\n425 / 890 = 0.4775...\n\nSo 280.4775, which rounds to 280.48.\n\nTherefore, Sales per store in 2024 was $280.48 million.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Sales per store,\" and in the context of Costco, they might refer to revenue per store, which is what we calculated. The net sales figure is the total revenue from stores, so dividing by the number of stores gives the average sales per store.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be $280.48 million.\n\nWait, but the question might expect it without the million, but since the original data is in millions, the answer should be in millions. So $280.48 million per store.\n\nBut let me check if the number of stores is correct. The Item 2 says \"At September 1, 2024, we operated 890 membership warehouses.\" So 890 stores.\n\nYes, that's the number to use.\n\nSo final answer: $280.48 million.\n\nBut let me check if the problem expects it in a different format. The instructions say \"correct financial format,\" so probably with two decimal places and the dollar sign.\n\nSo the answer should be $280.48 million.\n\nWait, but in the context of the problem, maybe they want it as a number without the million, but since the sales are in millions, the per store would also be in millions. So $280.48 million.\n\nYes, that's standard. For example, if total sales are $249,625 million and 890 stores, per store is $280.48 million.\n\nSo the final answer is $280.48 million.\n</think>\n\nTo determine Sales per store in 2024, divide the total net sales by the number of stores. From the financial statements:\n- Net sales for 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024: $249,625 million\n- Number of warehouses (stores) as of September 1, 2024: 890\n\nCalculation:  \n$249,625 \\div 890 = 280.4775...$  \nRounded to two decimal places: **$280.48 million**\n\n<answer>280.48</answer>",

I need to find the relevant data from the provided financial statements.\n\nFirst, I recall that Sales per square foot is calculated by dividing total sales by the total square footage of the operating space. The original context includes a section about warehouse properties. Let me look for that.\n\nIn the \"Item 2—Properties\" section, it says: \"At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International.\"\n\nSo total operating floor space is 130.9 million sq ft.\n\nNow, for the sales figure. The Consolidated Statements of Income show \"Net sales\" for the 52 Weeks Ended September 1, 2024, as $249,625 million.\n\nWait, the question is about Sales per sq ft, so I need to use the net sales figure. The total revenue includes membership fees, but sales per sq ft typically refers to net sales from merchandise, not membership fees. The problem says \"Sales per sq ft,\" so it's probably using net sales, which is $249,625 million.\n\nSo the calculation would be:\n\nNet Sales / Total Square Footage = $249,625 million / 130.9 million sq ft\n\nLet me compute that. 249,625 divided by 130.9. Let's see, 249,625 ÷ 130.9 ≈ 1,906.5. So approximately $1,907 per sq ft.\n\nWait, but I should check if the square footage is correct. The note says \"130.9 million square feet of operating floor space.\" Yes, that's the total. The net sales are $249,625 million.\n\nSo the calculation is 249,625 / 130.9 ≈ 1,906.5. Rounding to the nearest dollar, it's $1,907 per sq ft.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the numbers again. The net sales are $249,625 million, and the square footage is 130.9 million sq ft. So 249,625 divided by 130.9 equals approximately 1,906.5. So $1,907 per square foot.\n\nI think that's it. The key was to find the correct sales figure (net sales, not total revenue) and the total square footage from the properties section.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate Sales per sq ft in 2024, divide total net sales by total operating floor space:\n\n- Net sales (from Consolidated Statements of Income): $249,625 million\n- Total operating floor space (from Item 2—Properties): 130.9 million sq ft\n\nSales per sq ft = $249,625 / 130.9 ≈ $1,907\n\n<answer>:1907",

      "question": "What was Sales per sq ft cut by geography in 2024?",
      "ground_truth": "US: $2,021.33; Canada: $2,249.94 International: $1,458.27",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for \"Sales per sq ft cut by geography in 2024.\" Hmm, I need to figure out what exactly they're looking for. The term \"cut by geography\" might be a typo or misphrasing. Maybe they mean \"by geography\" or \"broken down by geography.\" \n\nLooking at the provided financial data, there's a section on segment reporting in Note 11. The segments are United States, Canada, and Other International. The question is about sales per square foot, so I need to find revenue and square footage data for each segment.\n\nFirst, I'll check the Consolidated Statements of Income for total revenue. The total revenue for 2024 is $254,453 million. But that's the total, not broken down by geography. The segment data in Note 11 shows:\n\n- United States: $184,143 million\n- Canada: $34,874 million\n- Other International: $35,436 million\n\nTotal revenue matches the $254,453 million from the income statement.\n\nNext, I need the square footage. The \"Item 2—Properties\" section states that at the end of 2024, warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space. The breakdown is:\n- U.S.: 91.1 million sq ft\n- Canada: 15.5 million sq ft\n- Other International: 24.3 million sq ft\n\nSo, sales per square foot for each segment would be segment revenue divided by segment square footage.\n\nLet me calculate each:\n\nUnited States:\n$184,143 million / 91.1 million sq ft = $2,021 per sq ft\n\nCanada:\n$34,874 million / 15.5 million sq ft = $2,250 per sq ft\n\nOther International:\n$35,436 million / 24.3 million sq ft = $1,458 per sq ft\n\nWait, but the question says \"Sales per sq ft cut by geography.\" Maybe \"cut\" is a typo for \"by\" or \"broken down by.\" The answer should present the sales per square foot for each geographic segment.\n\nI should verify if the square footage numbers are correct. The Item 2 section says \"At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International.\" That matches the numbers I used.\n\nSo the sales per square foot for each segment are as calculated. The question might be asking for these values. Since it's \"cut by geography,\" it's likely expecting the breakdown.\n\nNow, the user wants the final answer in a specific format. The answer should list each segment's sales per sq ft. But the question says \"Sales per sq ft cut by geography,\" which might mean they want the values for each geography. So the answer should present the three figures.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"provide the final answer to the question in the required format.\" The required format is concise, in financial format. So probably list each segment's sales per sq ft.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other data. The question is about 2024, which matches the data provided. The segment revenue and square footage are for 2024.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nUnited States: $2,021 per sq ft\n\nCanada: $2,250 per sq ft\n\nOther International: $1,458 per sq ft\n\nBut the user might want it in a specific order or format. The problem says \"concise,\" so maybe just the numbers in order. But the question says \"cut by geography,\" which might mean they want the values broken down by geography. So the answer should list each with their values.\n\nWait, the instruction says \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" So perhaps present it as:\n\nUS: $2,021, Canada: $2,250, Other Int'l: $1,458\n\nBut I need to confirm the calculations.\n\nUS: 184,143 / 91.1 = let's compute that. 184,143 ÷ 91.1 ≈ 2,021.33, so $2,021.\n\nCanada: 34,874 / 15.5 ≈ 2,250. So $2,250.\n\nOther Int'l: 35,436 / 24.3 ≈ 1,458.27, so $1,458.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be these three values. The problem might expect them listed in the order of the segments as presented in the financials: United States, Canada, Other International.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the three figures as calculated.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:US: $2,021, Canada: $2,250, Other International: $1,458",

      "question": "Company X trades at $15 per share and has 80 shares outstanding, with $80 in net income. Company Y trades at $30 per share, has 15 shares outstanding, and earns $20 in net income. Company X acquires Company Y at no premium, paying 60% in new stock and 40% in cash. After the transaction, what is the percentage change in Company X's EPS?",
      "ground_truth": "2%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the percentage change in Company X's EPS after acquiring Company Y. First, I should recall what EPS is—Earnings Per Share, which is net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.\n\nLet me start by calculating the current EPS for Company X before the acquisition. Company X has $80 in net income and 80 shares outstanding. So, EPS before acquisition would be 80 divided by 80, which is $1.00 per share.\n\nNow, Company Y has $20 in net income and 15 shares. But since Company X is acquiring Company Y at no premium, I need to figure out how the acquisition affects X's shares and net income.\n\nThe acquisition is paid with 60% in new stock and 40% in cash. Wait, but the cash part might not affect the shares, only the stock part will. Let me think. The total consideration for Company Y would be based on its market value. Since it's a no premium acquisition, the price paid should be equal to Company Y's market value.\n\nCompany Y trades at $30 per share with 15 shares outstanding, so its market cap is 30 * 15 = $450. So, Company X is paying $450 total for Company Y. But they're paying 60% in new stock and 40% in cash. So, 40% of $450 is cash, which is 0.4 * 450 = $180 cash. The remaining 60% is stock, which is 0.6 * 450 = $270 in new shares.\n\nWait, but how many new shares does Company X issue? The new stock is issued at Company X's current share price, right? Because they're paying with their own stock. Company X's share price is $15 per share. So, the number of new shares issued would be the value of the stock consideration divided by X's share price. So, $270 / $15 = 18 new shares.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The consideration for Y is $450 (market cap). 60% in stock, so $270 worth of X's stock. Since X's stock is $15, the number of new shares is 270 / 15 = 18. That seems right.\n\nSo, after the acquisition, Company X's new number of shares will be original 80 plus 18 new shares, so 98 shares.\n\nNow, the net income after acquisition. Company X's original net income is $80, and Company Y's is $20. So combined net income is 80 + 20 = $100. Wait, but do we need to consider any costs or anything? The problem doesn't mention any, so I think we just add the net incomes.\n\nWait, but the cash payment is $180, but that's a cash outflow, but it's not affecting the net income. Net income is just the earnings from operations, so the cash paid for acquisition doesn't reduce net income. So yes, combined net income is 80 + 20 = $100.\n\nSo, new EPS after acquisition is total net income divided by new shares: 100 / 98 ≈ $1.0204 per share.\n\nOriginal EPS was $1.00. So the change is 1.0204 - 1.00 = $0.0204. To find the percentage change, it's (0.0204 / 1.00) * 100 ≈ 2.04%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's make sure about the new shares. The acquisition is 60% in stock, so the value of the stock consideration is 60% of Y's market cap. Y's market cap is 30*15=450. So 60% of 450 is 270. X's share price is 15, so new shares = 270 / 15 = 18. So total shares after = 80 + 18 = 98. Correct.\n\nCombined net income: X's 80 + Y's 20 = 100. So EPS = 100 / 98 ≈ 1.0204. Original EPS was 80/80=1. So the change is (1.0204 - 1)/1 * 100 = 2.04%.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"percentage change in Company X's EPS\". So it's (New EPS - Old EPS)/Old EPS * 100. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if the cash payment affects anything. The cash payment is $180, but that's a cash outflow, not affecting the income statement. So net income remains 80 + 20 = 100. So that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: when they say \"acquires Company Y at no premium\", that means they're paying the market price, so the consideration is based on Y's market cap. So yes, 30*15=450. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the percentage change is approximately 2.04%. But let's compute it more precisely. 100 / 98 = 1.020408163... So the difference is 0.020408163, so percentage change is 2.0408163%, which rounds to 2.04%.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects rounding to two decimal places, so 2.04%. Alternatively, maybe they want it as a fraction. Let's see.\n\nWait, let's check the math again. Original EPS: 80/80 = 1.00.\n\nAfter acquisition:\n\nNet income: 80 + 20 = 100.\n\nShares: 80 + (0.6 * 450)/15 = 80 + (270)/15 = 80 + 18 = 98.\n\nEPS: 100 / 98 ≈ 1.0204.\n\nChange: (1.0204 - 1)/1 * 100 = 2.04%.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but another way to think: sometimes when companies acquire, they might have to account for the purchase price, but in this case, since it's a no premium acquisition, and they're paying with stock and cash, but the net income is just the sum of both companies' net incomes. So I think that's correct.\n\nSo the percentage change is approximately 2.04%. So the answer should be 2.04%.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem says \"percentage change\", so it's (New - Old)/Old * 100. So yes, (1.0204 - 1)/1 * 100 = 2.04%.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just make sure there's no other step I missed. For example, is the cash payment affecting the net income? No, because cash payment is a financing activity, not affecting income. So net income remains 80 + 20 = 100. Correct.\n\nAnother check: if they paid entirely in cash, the shares wouldn't change, but here they're paying 60% in stock, so shares increase. So yes, the new shares are 80 + 18 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo the final answer should be 2.04%.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the percentage change in Company X's EPS after acquiring Company Y:\n\n1. **Pre-acquisition EPS for Company X**:\n   - Net Income = $80\n   - Shares Outstanding = 80\n   - EPS = $80 / 80 = $1.00\n\n2. **Acquisition Details**:\n   - Company Y's market cap = $30/share × 15 shares = $450\n   - Consideration: 60% stock (value = $450 × 0.6 = $270), 40% cash ($180)\n   - New shares issued by X = $270 / $15 (X's share price) = 18 shares\n\n3. **Post-acquisition**:\n   - Total shares = 80 + 18 = 98\n   - Combined net income = $80 (X) + $20 (Y) = $100\n   - New EPS = $100 / 98 ≈ $1.0204\n\n4. **Percentage change in EPS**:\n   - Change = ($1.0204 - $1.00) / $1.00 × 100 ≈ 2.04%\n\n<answer>:2.04%",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the future value of a deposit with an annual IRR of 10% over three years. The user deposited $80 right now.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what IRR means. IRR stands for Internal Rate of Return, which in this context is the annual rate of return. So, if the annual IRR is 10%, that means the investment grows at 10% each year.\n\nThe formula for future value with compound interest is FV = PV * (1 + r)^n, where PV is the present value, r is the annual rate, and n is the number of years.\n\nHere, PV is $80, r is 10% or 0.10, and n is 3 years.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers: FV = 80 * (1 + 0.10)^3.\n\nCalculating (1.10)^3 first. Let's do that step by step. 1.10 squared is 1.21, then multiply by 1.10 again: 1.21 * 1.10 = 1.331.\n\nThen multiply by 80: 80 * 1.331 = 106.48.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication. 80 * 1.331. 80 * 1 = 80, 80 * 0.3 = 24, 80 * 0.03 = 2.4, 80 * 0.001 = 0.08. Adding those up: 80 +24=104, +2.4=106.4, +0.08=106.48. So $106.48.\n\nI should confirm if it's simple interest or compound. The problem says annual IRR, which typically implies compounding. So compound interest is correct here.\n\nSo the future value after three years should be $106.48.\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the future value of the deposit, use the compound interest formula:  \nFV = PV × (1 + r)^n  \nWhere PV = $80, r = 10% (0.10), and n = 3 years.  \nFV = 80 × (1.10)^3 = 80 × 1.331 = 106.48  \n\n<answer>:$106.48",

      "question": "Let's say you're going to receive $75 in 7 years, with a discount rate of 9%. What is its value today?",
      "ground_truth": "$41.06",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the present value of $75 received in 7 years with a 9% discount rate. Hmm, present value... right, that's using the present value formula. The formula for present value (PV) is FV divided by (1 + r)^n, where FV is the future value, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods.\n\nSo here, FV is $75, r is 9% or 0.09, and n is 7 years. Let me plug those numbers in. So PV = 75 / (1 + 0.09)^7. Let me calculate the denominator first. 1.09 to the power of 7. Let me do that step by step. 1.09^7. Maybe I can use the rule of exponents or just compute it.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that (1.09)^7 can be calculated as e^(7*ln(1.09)), but maybe it's easier to just multiply it out. Let's see:\n\n1.09^2 = 1.1881\n\n1.09^3 = 1.1881 * 1.09 ≈ 1.295029\n\n1.09^4 ≈ 1.295029 * 1.09 ≈ 1.41158161\n\n1.09^5 ≈ 1.41158161 * 1.09 ≈ 1.53862395\n\n1.09^6 ≈ 1.53862395 * 1.09 ≈ 1.67710011\n\n1.09^7 ≈ 1.67710011 * 1.09 ≈ 1.82803912\n\nSo approximately 1.8280. Then PV = 75 / 1.82803912 ≈ let's calculate that. 75 divided by 1.828. Let's see, 1.828 times 40 is 73.12, so 40 would give 73.12, so 75 - 73.12 = 1.88, so 1.88 / 1.828 ≈ 1.028. So total is approximately 41.028. Wait, maybe better to do exact division.\n\n75 ÷ 1.82803912. Let's compute 75 / 1.82803912. Let me use a calculator approach. 1.82803912 * 41 = 1.82803912 * 40 + 1.82803912 = 73.1215648 + 1.82803912 = 74.9496039. That's very close to 75. So 41 gives 74.9496, so the present value is approximately $41.00. Wait, 74.9496 is just under 75, so maybe 41.00 is the approximate value.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator for more precision: 75 / (1.09)^7. Let me check with a calculator. (1.09)^7 is approximately 1.828039. So 75 / 1.828039 ≈ 41.02. So rounding to the nearest cent, it's $41.02.\n\nWait, but maybe the question expects a specific rounding. Let me confirm. The standard present value calculation would give approximately $41.02. Let me verify with another method. Using the present value formula:\n\nPV = FV / (1 + r)^n = 75 / (1.09)^7 ≈ 75 / 1.828039 ≈ 41.02.\n\nYes, so the present value is approximately $41.02.\n</think>\n\nTo find the present value of $75 received in 7 years with a 9% discount rate, use the present value formula:  \nPV = FV / (1 + r)^n  \nWhere FV = $75, r = 0.09, n = 7.  \nCalculating:  \nPV = 75 / (1.09)^7 ≈ 75 / 1.828039 ≈ 41.02  \n\n<answer>:$41.02",

The difference is in the leverage turns: X requires 4 turns, Y needs 7 turns. The question is which one to invest in and why.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"turns of leverage\" means. From what I remember, leverage turns refer to how many times the investment is leveraged. For example, 4 turns might mean that for every $1 of equity, you're using $4 in debt, so total capital is $5. Wait, actually, leverage turns are often calculated as total debt divided by equity. So if it's 4 turns, that would mean debt is 4 times equity. So total capital would be equity + debt = 1 + 4 = 5. So the debt-to-equity ratio is 4:1.\n\nBut the key point here is that higher leverage turns mean more debt relative to equity. Now, both have the same levered IRR of 25%. But levered IRR already factors in the debt. So if both have the same IRR, why would the number of leverage turns matter?\n\nWait, maybe the higher leverage turns mean that the company is using more debt, which could be riskier. But the question is about which one to invest in. If both have the same IRR, but one uses more leverage, perhaps the one with fewer leverage turns is safer because it has less debt. But the IRR is already levered, so the higher leverage might be amplifying the returns, but also increasing risk.\n\nBut the problem states that both have the same levered IRR. So the IRR already accounts for the debt. So if Company Y uses 7 turns of leverage versus X's 4, that means Y is using more debt. But since the IRR is the same, maybe the higher leverage in Y is actually making the return higher on the equity, but wait, the IRR is given as the same. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the levered IRR is the return on equity, so if you have more leverage, the equity return (IRR) would be higher if the project's return is higher than the cost of debt. But in this case, both have the same levered IRR. So perhaps the underlying project return is the same, but with different leverage, but the IRR is adjusted for that. Wait, but if the levered IRR is the same, then the equity return is the same. But higher leverage usually means higher risk. So even though the IRR is the same, the risk is higher for the company with more leverage (Y with 7 turns vs X's 4). So you'd prefer the lower leverage because it's less risky, even if the IRR is the same.\n\nWait, but the question is about which to invest in. If both have the same IRR, but Y has higher leverage, then Y is riskier. So you'd choose X because it's less risky. But why would the levered IRR be the same? Let's think. Suppose the unlevered return is the same for both. Then, with higher leverage, the levered IRR would be higher if the cost of debt is less than the unlevered return. But here, the levered IRR is the same. So maybe the unlevered return is lower for Y, but they're using more debt to get the same levered IRR. Wait, but the problem states that both have the same levered IRR. So perhaps the higher leverage in Y is offset by a lower unlevered return, but the levered IRR ends up the same. However, the key point is that higher leverage increases risk. So even if the IRR is the same, the risk is higher for Y. Therefore, you'd prefer X with lower leverage.\n\nAnother angle: Leverage turns. If it's 4 turns, that's 4x debt to equity, so debt is 4 times equity. So for every $1 equity, $4 debt. Total capital $5. For Y, 7 turns: $7 debt per $1 equity, total $8. So Y has a higher debt-to-equity ratio. Higher debt means higher interest payments, which could be a problem if the company's cash flow isn't sufficient. So even if the IRR is the same, the risk of default or needing to refinance at higher rates is higher for Y. Therefore, X is the safer investment with the same return.\n\nSo the answer should be Company X because it uses less leverage, thus lower risk, while offering the same IRR as Company Y.\n</think>\n\nLeverage turns indicate the debt-to-equity ratio. Higher leverage (7 turns for Y vs. 4 for X) increases financial risk without improving the levered IRR, which is already equal. Company X’s lower leverage reduces risk exposure (e.g., interest burden, refinancing risk) while delivering the same return. Thus, X is preferable for risk-adjusted returns.\n\n<answer>:Company X",

      "question": "You have two potential investments, Company X and Company Y. Both companies are available at the same purchase price and both project a levered IRR of 25%. However, investing in Company X requires 4 turns of leverage while investing in Company Y requires 7 turns. Which investment has a higher unlevered IRR?",
      "ground_truth": "Company X",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about comparing the unlevered IRR of two investments, Company X and Company Y. Both have the same levered IRR of 25%, but different leverage turns: 4 for X and 7 for Y. The question is which one has a higher unlevered IRR.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what levered and unlevered IRR mean. Levered IRR is the return on equity after accounting for debt, while unlevered IRR is the return on the entire investment without considering debt. The key here is understanding how leverage affects the IRR.\n\nLeverage amplifies returns. If you use more debt (higher leverage turns), the returns on equity (levered IRR) can be higher, but the unlevered IRR is the return on the asset before debt. Wait, but the problem states both have the same levered IRR. So, if Company Y uses more leverage (7 turns vs 4), but their levered IRR is the same, that suggests that the underlying asset's return (unlevered IRR) must be lower for Y because the higher leverage is being used to achieve the same levered IRR.\n\nWait, let me think again. Levered IRR = Unlevered IRR + (Unlevered IRR - Cost of Debt) * Leverage Ratio. But maybe it's simpler. If you have more leverage, the same unlevered IRR would lead to a higher levered IRR. But here, the levered IRR is the same, so the one with higher leverage must have a lower unlevered IRR to compensate. Because if you have more debt, the return on equity (levered) would be higher if the unlevered return is the same. But since both levered IRRs are equal, the one with more leverage (Y) must have a lower unlevered IRR. So, Company X, with less leverage (4 turns), would have a higher unlevered IRR than Company Y (7 turns).\n\nWait, let's verify. Suppose unlevered IRR is U. Levered IRR is calculated as U + (U - D) * L, where D is the cost of debt and L is leverage. But maybe the exact formula isn't necessary here. The key point is that higher leverage (more debt) leads to higher levered IRR if unlevered is fixed. So if levered IRR is the same, then the one with higher leverage must have a lower unlevered IRR. Therefore, Company X (4 turns) has higher unlevered IRR than Y (7 turns).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be Company X.\n</think>\n\nLevered IRR is influenced by the level of debt (leverage). Higher leverage amplifies returns, so for the same levered IRR, a higher leverage ratio implies a lower unlevered IRR. Since Company Y uses 7 turns of leverage (more than Company X's 4 turns) but both have the same 25% levered IRR, Company Y must have a lower unlevered IRR to offset the higher leverage. Thus, Company X has a higher unlevered IRR.\n\n<answer>:Company X",

Company Y trades at $8 per share, with a P/E ratio of 2x, and has 120 shares outstanding. Company X plans to buy Company Y for $9 per share, funding half of the purchase with cash (raised through debt at a 6% cost of debt that matures over four years) and half with newly issued stock. The deal also incurs $15 in financing costs and $20 in transaction fees. Is this acquisition accretive or dilutive to Company X?",
      "ground_truth": "Accretive",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is whether Company X's acquisition of Company Y is accretive or dilutive. I need to figure out if the earnings per share (EPS) after the acquisition will be higher or lower than before.\n\nFirst, let's recall what accretive and dilutive mean. If the combined company's EPS is higher than Company X's original EPS, it's accretive. If it's lower, it's dilutive. So, I need to calculate both the pre-acquisition EPS of Company X and the post-acquisition EPS after the deal.\n\nStarting with Company X. The P/E ratio is 2x, and the share price is $10. The P/E ratio is Price per Share divided by Earnings per Share (EPS). So, EPS = Price / P/E. For Company X, that's $10 / 2 = $5 per share. They have 300 shares outstanding, so total earnings would be EPS * shares = $5 * 300 = $1,500.\n\nNow, Company Y. P/E is also 2x, share price $8. So EPS for Y is $8 / 2 = $4 per share. Shares outstanding are 120, so total earnings for Y are $4 * 120 = $480.\n\nCompany X is buying Y for $9 per share. The total cost for Y's shares would be 120 shares * $9 = $1,080. Half is paid with cash (raised via debt at 6% cost), half with new stock. So, cash portion is $540, stock portion is $540.\n\nWait, the stock portion: since X's share price is $10, the number of new shares issued would be $540 / $10 = 54 shares. So total shares after acquisition would be 300 + 54 = 354.\n\nBut wait, the cash is raised through debt. The debt is $540, with a 6% cost. But since it's a 4-year maturity, I need to calculate the annual interest expense. The interest would be 6% of $540, which is $32.40 per year. But since the question is about EPS, which is annual, we need to consider the interest expense as a reduction in earnings.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"funding half of the purchase with cash (raised through debt at a 6% cost of debt that matures over four years)\". So the interest cost is annual. So for EPS calculation, we need to subtract the interest expense from the combined earnings.\n\nAlso, there are financing costs of $15 and transaction fees of $20. These are one-time costs, so they would be subtracted from earnings as well. Wait, but are these considered as part of the acquisition cost? Typically, financing costs and transaction fees are expensed immediately, so they reduce the earnings in the year of acquisition.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Calculate Company X's pre-acquisition earnings: $1,500 (as above).\n2. Calculate Company Y's earnings: $480.\n3. Total combined earnings before considering acquisition costs: $1,500 + $480 = $1,980.\n4. Subtract the interest expense on the debt: $540 * 6% = $32.40.\n5. Subtract the financing costs ($15) and transaction fees ($20), total $35.\n6. So, net earnings after acquisition costs: $1,980 - $32.40 - $35 = $1,912.60.\n\nNow, the new number of shares: original 300 + new shares from stock portion. The stock portion is $540, and X's share price is $10, so 540 / 10 = 54 new shares. Total shares = 300 + 54 = 354.\n\nPost-acquisition EPS = $1,912.60 / 354 ≈ $5.403.\n\nOriginal EPS of X was $5.00. So $5.403 > $5.00, which means it's accretive.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The interest expense is $32.40 per year, so that's a reduction. The financing costs and transaction fees are $15 + $20 = $35, which are also subtracted. So total deductions: 32.40 + 35 = 67.40. So combined earnings after deductions: 1980 - 67.40 = 1912.60. Correct.\n\nNew shares: 300 + 54 = 354. 1912.60 / 354 ≈ 5.403. Original EPS was 5.00. So yes, higher, so accretive.\n\nWait, but another way to check: sometimes people forget that the stock is issued at X's price, so the number of new shares is based on X's share price. Since X is paying $9 per share for Y, but issuing new shares at $10, so the number of new shares is (540 / 10) = 54. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if they had issued shares at Y's price, but no, the new shares are issued by X, so at X's market price of $10.\n\nAnother point: the P/E ratio for both companies is 2x, so their earnings are correctly calculated as price / P/E.\n\nWait, Company Y's earnings: $8 price / 2 P/E = $4 EPS, times 120 shares = $480. Correct.\n\nCompany X: $10 / 2 = $5 EPS, 300 shares = $1,500. Correct.\n\nSo combined earnings before costs: 1500 + 480 = 1980. Then subtract interest and fees: 32.40 + 35 = 67.40. So 1980 - 67.40 = 1912.60.\n\nNew shares: 300 + (540 / 10) = 300 + 54 = 354.\n\nEPS: 1912.60 / 354 ≈ 5.403.\n\nOriginal EPS: 5.00. So 5.403 > 5.00, so accretive.\n\nTherefore, the acquisition is accretive.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the acquisition is accretive or dilutive, compare Company X's pre-acquisition EPS to the post-acquisition EPS.\n\n**Pre-acquisition EPS (Company X):**  \nP/E = 2x, Share Price = $10 → EPS = $10 / 2 = **$5.00**  \nTotal Earnings = $5.00 × 300 shares = **$1,500**\n\n**Post-acquisition calculations:**  \n- **Company Y's earnings:** P/E = 2x, Share Price = $8 → EPS = $8 / 2 = $4.00  \n  Total Earnings = $4.00 × 120 shares = **$480**  \n- **Total combined earnings before costs:** $1,500 + $480 = **$1,980**  \n- **Deductions:**  \n  - Interest on debt: $540 (half of $1,080 purchase price) × 6% = **$32.40**  \n  - Financing costs + transaction fees: $15 + $20 = **$35**  \n  - Total deductions = $32.40 + $35 = **$67.40**  \n- **Net earnings post-acquisition:** $1,980 - $67.40 = **$1,912.60**  \n- **New shares outstanding:**  \n  - Original shares: 300  \n  - New shares issued (stock portion: $540 / $10 share price): **54**  \n  - Total shares = 300 + 54 = **354**  \n- **Post-acquisition EPS:** $1,912.60 / 354 ≈ **$5.40**  \n\n**Comparison:**  \nPre-acquisition EPS = $5.00  \nPost-acquisition EPS ≈ $5.40  \nSince $5.40 > $5.00, the acquisition is **accretive**.\n\n<answer>:accretive",

      "question": "Suppose a company issues 100 million in debt and uses the proceeds to repurchase its own shares. What is the effect on the company's Enterprise Value (increase, decrease, or no change)?",
      "ground_truth": "No change",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about Enterprise Value after a company issues debt to repurchase shares. Hmm, first I need to recall what Enterprise Value (EV) actually is. From what I remember, EV is calculated as Market Capitalization plus Debt minus Cash. So EV = Equity Value + Debt - Cash.\n\nThe question says the company issues $100 million in debt and uses the proceeds to repurchase its own shares. So they're taking on $100 million in new debt, and then using that cash to buy back shares. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nWhen they issue $100 million in debt, their debt increases by $100 million. Then they use that $100 million to repurchase shares. Repurchasing shares would reduce the equity value because they're buying back shares, so the market cap would go down by $100 million. Wait, but does the repurchase affect the cash? Let's think.\n\nWhen they issue debt, they receive $100 million in cash. Then they use that cash to repurchase shares. So the cash is used up, meaning the cash balance decreases by $100 million. But in the EV formula, we subtract cash. So if they had $100 million in cash from the debt, and then they spend it all on repurchasing shares, the cash would go down by $100 million. Wait, but initially, when they issue debt, they get cash, so cash increases by $100 million. Then they use that cash to buy shares, so cash decreases by $100 million. So net effect on cash is zero? Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nWhen the company issues debt, they receive $100 million in cash. So cash increases by $100 million. Then they use that $100 million to repurchase shares. So cash decreases by $100 million. So the net change in cash is zero. But the debt has increased by $100 million.\n\nSo let's look at the EV formula again: EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash.\n\nBefore the transaction:\n- Debt: let's say D\n- Cash: C\n- Market Cap: M\n\nAfter issuing debt and repurchasing shares:\n- Debt becomes D + 100\n- Cash becomes C + 100 (from the debt issuance) - 100 (used to repurchase shares) = C\n- Market Cap: Since they repurchased shares with the cash, the market cap would decrease by $100 million. Wait, if they repurchase shares, the number of shares decreases, so the market cap (which is share price times shares outstanding) would decrease. But the exact amount depends on the price. However, in this case, they're using the cash from the debt to buy back shares, so the market cap should decrease by $100 million. Wait, but if they use $100 million to buy back shares, the market cap would decrease by $100 million. So Market Cap becomes M - 100.\n\nSo let's plug into EV:\n\nOriginal EV = M + D - C\n\nNew EV = (M - 100) + (D + 100) - C\n\nSimplify that: M - 100 + D + 100 - C = M + D - C. So the EV remains the same.\n\nWait, so the increase in debt is offset by the decrease in market cap, and the cash remains the same (since they used the cash from the debt to buy shares, so cash doesn't change). Therefore, EV doesn't change.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Enterprise Value is the value of the company's operations, excluding the cash and debt. When you issue debt and use it to buy back shares, you're effectively replacing equity with debt, but the total value of the company (EV) shouldn't change because the cash used to repurchase shares is exactly the amount of debt issued. So the net effect on EV is zero.\n\nI think that's right. Let me check if there's any other factor. For example, if the repurchase was done at a price different from the market value, but the question doesn't specify that. Assuming it's a standard repurchase, the market cap would decrease by the amount spent. So yes, the EV remains unchanged.\n\nSo the answer should be no change.\n</think>\n\nEnterprise Value (EV) is calculated as Market Capitalization + Debt - Cash. When a company issues $100 million in debt, debt increases by $100 million, and cash increases by $100 million. Using the $100 million to repurchase shares reduces market capitalization by $100 million (as shares are bought back at market value). The cash decrease from the repurchase offsets the initial cash increase, leaving cash unchanged. Thus, the net effect on EV is zero: (Market Cap - 100) + (Debt + 100) - Cash = Market Cap + Debt - Cash.\n\n<answer>:no change",

      "question": "Suppose a company raises 25 million of debt and uses it to buy back shares from its shareholders. How does this transaction affect the firm's equity value (increase, decrease, or no change)?",
      "ground_truth": "Decrease",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the company raises 25 million in debt and uses it to buy back shares. The question is how this affects the firm's equity value.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic finance concepts. When a company takes on debt, it's increasing its liabilities. But the key here is what happens to equity. Equity value is typically the market value of the company's shares, right?\n\nWait, but when they buy back shares using the debt, they're reducing the number of shares outstanding. However, the debt itself is a liability, so the total assets would increase by the 25 million (since they're using the debt to buy shares, which are assets? Wait, no. Wait, when you take debt, you get cash. So the company receives 25 million in cash (an asset) and incurs 25 million in debt (a liability). Then, they use that cash to buy back shares. So the cash goes down by 25 million, and the shares are repurchased, which reduces equity.\n\nBut equity value is the market value of equity. The buyback reduces the number of shares, but does it affect the total equity value? Hmm. Wait, the company is using debt to buy back shares. So the total assets (cash) increase by 25 million when they take the debt, but then they spend that cash to buy back shares, so assets go back to original. Wait, no. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Raise 25 million debt. So cash (asset) +25M, debt (liability) +25M.\n\nStep 2: Use the 25M cash to buy back shares. So cash (asset) -25M, and shares are repurchased, which reduces equity (since equity is assets minus liabilities, but the repurchase is a reduction in equity). Wait, but when you buy back shares, you're reducing the equity by the amount paid. So the equity decreases by 25 million because you're buying back shares with cash.\n\nBut wait, the company's total value (assets minus liabilities) should remain the same? Wait, no. Let's think about the balance sheet.\n\nBefore the transaction:\nAssets = A\nLiabilities = L\nEquity = A - L\n\nAfter raising debt:\nAssets = A + 25M (cash)\nLiabilities = L + 25M\nEquity = (A +25M) - (L +25M) = A - L. So equity remains the same.\n\nThen, using the 25M cash to buy back shares:\nAssets = (A +25M) -25M = A\nLiabilities = L +25M\nEquity = A - (L +25M) = (A - L) -25M.\n\nWait, so equity decreases by 25 million. But the question is about equity value. Wait, but equity value is the market value, not the book value. Hmm. Wait, but the question might be referring to book equity or market equity. The question says \"equity value,\" which usually refers to market value.\n\nBut in reality, when a company buys back shares using debt, the market value of equity might not change immediately because the debt increases the risk, but the question might be assuming no change in the market's perception. Wait, but the question is probably testing the basic accounting.\n\nWait, the key point here is that the company is using debt to repurchase shares. The total value of the firm (debt + equity) should remain the same as before, assuming no taxes or other factors. Wait, but in reality, debt is cheaper, so maybe the value changes, but the question is probably assuming a perfect market with no taxes.\n\nWait, but the question is about equity value. Let's think: when you buy back shares, you're reducing the number of shares, but the total equity value (market cap) would decrease by the amount spent, right? Because you're paying cash (which was raised via debt) to buy back shares. So if you spend 25 million to buy back shares, the equity value decreases by 25 million. But wait, the company's total value (debt + equity) should be the same as before, but the equity is now lower by 25 million, and debt is higher by 25 million.\n\nWait, but the question is about equity value. So if the company's equity value was, say, E before, after the transaction, equity value is E - 25 million. But wait, no. Let's think of it as the market value. Suppose the company had a market cap of, say, $100 million. They take on $25 million debt, so now they have $25 million in debt and the equity is still $100 million? Wait, no. The market value of the firm (debt + equity) should be the same as before, assuming no change in the firm's value. So if they take on debt, the equity value would adjust to reflect the increased leverage.\n\nBut the question is probably expecting a simple answer based on accounting. In accounting terms, when you buy back shares with cash, equity decreases by the amount paid. But here, the cash came from debt. So the net effect on equity is that the company has reduced equity by 25 million (because they bought back shares) but also increased debt by 25 million. However, the equity value (market value) might not change if the market perceives the debt as neutral. Wait, but the question is likely testing the basic concept that buying back shares with debt doesn't change the total value of the firm, but the equity value (as a percentage) might change. Wait, no.\n\nWait, another angle: the firm's total value (V) = debt + equity. If the firm's value doesn't change (assuming no tax benefits or other factors), then when they take on debt, the equity value would decrease by the amount of debt, but that's not right. Wait, no. If the firm's value is V, then V = D + E. If they issue D new debt, then V remains the same (assuming no change in the firm's operations), so E = V - D. So if D increases by 25 million, E decreases by 25 million. But the question is about the equity value. So the equity value decreases by 25 million. But the question is phrased as \"how does this transaction affect the firm's equity value?\" So the answer would be decrease.\n\nWait, but wait. When they buy back shares, they're reducing the equity. So the equity value (market cap) would decrease by the amount spent on the buyback. Since they used the debt proceeds to buy back shares, the equity value decreases by 25 million. So the answer is decrease.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Let's think of an example. Suppose a company has 100 shares at $10 each, so equity value is $1,000. They take $25 million debt, so they have $25 million cash. Then they buy back 2.5 million shares (assuming $10 per share), so now they have 97.5 million shares. The equity value would be $1,000 - $25 million = $975 million. Wait, but the market value might not be exactly that because the price per share might adjust. But in the context of this question, it's probably assuming that the buyback is at the current market price, so the total equity value decreases by the amount spent.\n\nAlternatively, if the company uses the debt to buy back shares, the total value of the firm (debt + equity) remains the same as before the transaction. Before the transaction, the firm's value was equity (E). After, it's debt (25M) + equity (E - 25M) = E. So the equity value has decreased by 25 million. Therefore, the answer is decrease.\n\nWait, but another way: the company's assets are the same as before (they took debt, got cash, then spent cash to buy shares, so assets are back to original), but liabilities increased by 25 million. So equity = assets - liabilities. If assets are same, liabilities increased by 25M, so equity decreased by 25M. So yes, equity value decreases.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be decrease.\n</think>\n\nThe company raises $25 million in debt, increasing liabilities by $25 million. It then uses the debt proceeds to buy back shares, reducing equity by $25 million (as the repurchase decreases equity value by the amount paid). The balance sheet shows assets remain unchanged (cash inflow from debt offset by cash outflow for buyback), but liabilities increase, leading to a decrease in equity value. The market value of equity decreases by $25 million.\n\n<answer>:decrease",

      "question": "Consider a firm with a market cap of 800 million and net income of 80 million that takes on 100 million in debt to buy back shares. How does this transaction influence its P/E multiple (increase, decrease or no change)?",
      "ground_truth": "Decrease",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about how taking on debt to buy back shares affects a firm's P/E multiple. The firm has a market cap of $800 million and net income of $80 million. They take on $100 million in debt to buy back shares.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what P/E multiple is. P/E stands for Price-to-Earnings ratio, which is calculated as Market Cap divided by Net Income. So, the original P/E would be 800 / 80 = 10.\n\nNow, the firm is taking on $100 million in debt to buy back shares. When a company buys back shares, the number of shares outstanding decreases. But how does that affect the market cap? Wait, market cap is the total market value of the company's equity. If they buy back shares, the market cap should decrease because they're reducing the number of shares. But wait, they're using debt, so the total assets would increase by the debt, but the equity would decrease by the amount spent on buyback.\n\nWait, let's think step by step. The company takes $100 million debt. So, they have $100 million more in debt, but they use that to buy back shares. The market cap is based on equity. If they buy back shares worth $100 million, the market cap would decrease by $100 million. So new market cap would be 800 - 100 = $700 million.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? When a company buys back shares, the market cap (which is share price times shares outstanding) would decrease because the number of shares is reduced. However, the share price might adjust. But in this case, the problem states the market cap is initially $800 million. If they buy back shares using debt, the market cap should decrease by the amount spent on the buyback. So, $800 million minus $100 million equals $700 million.\n\nNow, what about net income? The problem states the net income is $80 million. But when they take on debt, they have to pay interest. The interest expense would reduce net income. Wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about interest rates or the interest expense. Hmm. The question says \"net income of 80 million\" before the transaction. But after taking on debt, the net income would decrease because of the interest expense. However, the problem doesn't provide the interest rate, so maybe we're supposed to assume that the interest expense is zero or that the net income remains the same? That's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says \"net income of 80 million\" as the original figure. If they take on debt, the interest expense would lower net income. But without knowing the interest rate, we can't calculate the exact new net income. However, maybe the question is assuming that the net income remains unchanged? That seems odd, but perhaps in the context of the problem, they're ignoring the interest expense for simplicity. Maybe it's a trick question where the P/E is calculated before considering the interest, but that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is testing the understanding that share buybacks reduce the number of shares, thus increasing earnings per share (EPS), but the P/E is based on market cap and net income. Wait, but if market cap decreases and net income decreases (due to interest), the effect on P/E could be ambiguous. But without knowing the interest expense, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the interest expense and assume net income stays the same.\n\nWait, let's check the original problem again. It says \"net income of 80 million\" and then takes on debt to buy back shares. The question is about the P/E multiple. If we assume that the net income remains the same (ignoring interest expense), then the new market cap is 800 - 100 = 700 million. So new P/E would be 700 / 80 = 8.75, which is lower than the original 10. So P/E decreases.\n\nBut wait, why would the market cap decrease by 100 million? Let's think. Market cap is the total market value of equity. If the company buys back shares worth $100 million, the equity value decreases by $100 million. So yes, market cap becomes 700 million. But if the company takes on $100 million debt, the total assets increase by $100 million (cash), but the equity decreases by $100 million (since they used cash to buy back shares). So the equity value (market cap) is reduced by $100 million.\n\nBut the problem is, when they buy back shares, the market cap is the price per share times the number of shares. If they buy back shares, the number of shares decreases, so if the price per share stays the same, the market cap would decrease. But in reality, the share price might adjust. However, in this problem, we're given the initial market cap, and we're to assume that the buyback is done at the current market price, so the market cap decreases by the amount spent on the buyback.\n\nSo, original market cap: 800 million. After buying back 100 million in shares, market cap is 700 million. Net income: if we assume no interest expense (since it's not mentioned), then net income remains 80 million. So new P/E is 700 / 80 = 8.75, which is lower than 10. So P/E decreases.\n\nBut wait, another angle: sometimes, when companies buy back shares, the market might react positively, increasing the share price, but the problem doesn't mention that. We're to assume the market cap changes only due to the buyback amount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the debt affects the net income. Let's say the interest expense is, for example, 5% of 100 million, so 5 million. Then net income becomes 75 million. Then new P/E would be 700 / 75 ≈ 9.33, which is still lower than 10. So even with interest expense, it's still lower. So regardless, the P/E would decrease.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the interest rate, so maybe we're supposed to ignore it. In many textbook problems, they might ignore the interest expense for simplicity when the question is about the effect of buybacks on P/E, assuming that the net income remains the same. So the key point is that market cap decreases (since equity is reduced by the buyback amount), while net income stays the same (or decreases less than the market cap), leading to a lower P/E.\n\nOriginal P/E: 800 / 80 = 10.\n\nAfter buyback: Market cap = 800 - 100 = 700. Net income = 80 (assuming no interest). New P/E = 700 / 80 = 8.75. So it's lower. Therefore, the P/E decreases.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you buy back shares, the number of shares decreases, so EPS increases. But P/E is market cap / net income. Market cap is price per share times shares outstanding. If shares outstanding decrease, but the price per share might stay the same or adjust. However, in this problem, the market cap is given as 800 million. If they buy back shares worth 100 million, the market cap becomes 700 million. So regardless of the share price, the total market cap is reduced by 100 million. So the calculation as above holds.\n\nTherefore, the P/E multiple decreases.\n</think>\n\nThe firm's original P/E ratio is calculated as market cap divided by net income: 800 / 80 = 10. After taking on $100 million in debt to buy back shares, the market cap decreases by $100 million (to $700 million), assuming no change in net income (interest expense is not specified and typically ignored in such problems). The new P/E ratio is 700 / 80 = 8.75, which is lower than the original 10. Thus, the P/E multiple decreases.\n\n<answer>:decrease",

      "question": "A firm generating 50 of EBITDA at a 20% EBITDA margin is bought at a 10x multiple, using 40% debt to finance the deal. If the company has 100 of cash at exit and is sold at a 10x multiple after five years, what annual revenue growth rate is needed to receive a 25% IRR?",
      "ground_truth": "15%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. The question is asking for the annual revenue growth rate needed to achieve a 25% IRR over five years. Let me break down all the given information first.\n\nThe firm has an EBITDA of 50 at a 20% EBITDA margin. Wait, EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue, so if EBITDA is 50 and margin is 20%, then revenue must be 50 / 0.20 = 250. So initial revenue is 250.\n\nThey're bought at a 10x EBITDA multiple. So the purchase price is 10 * 50 = 500. They use 40% debt to finance the deal, so debt is 0.4 * 500 = 200, and equity is 500 - 200 = 300. Wait, but the problem mentions \"100 of cash at exit.\" Hmm, cash at exit is 100, so maybe the exit value is adjusted for that.\n\nAfter five years, they sell at a 10x multiple. But the exit EBITDA would be higher due to revenue growth. Let's denote the annual revenue growth rate as 'g'. Since revenue is growing at 'g' annually, and EBITDA margin remains 20% (assuming margin stays constant), EBITDA will grow at the same rate as revenue.\n\nInitial revenue: 250 (since EBITDA 50 / 20% margin). After 5 years, revenue = 250 * (1 + g)^5. Therefore, EBITDA at exit = revenue * 20% = 250 * (1 + g)^5 * 0.20 = 50 * (1 + g)^5.\n\nExit EBITDA = 50*(1+g)^5. Exit value (enterprise value) = 10x * exit EBITDA = 10 * 50*(1+g)^5 = 500*(1+g)^5.\n\nBut they have 100 cash at exit. So the equity value at exit would be enterprise value minus debt plus cash. Wait, but the debt might have been paid down or not. The problem says \"using 40% debt to finance the deal,\" but it doesn't mention debt repayment. Assuming the debt is still outstanding at exit, but the problem states \"100 of cash at exit,\" so maybe the cash is part of the exit proceeds.\n\nWait, the initial deal: purchase price 500, 40% debt (200), so equity paid 300. At exit, the company is sold at 10x multiple, so enterprise value is 10x exit EBITDA. But they have 100 cash at exit. So the equity value would be enterprise value minus debt plus cash. Wait, enterprise value is typically EV = equity value + debt - cash. So equity value = EV - debt + cash.\n\nBut let's clarify. The exit EV is 10x EBITDA. The company has 100 cash at exit, so the equity value would be EV - debt + cash. But the debt might still be there. The problem says \"using 40% debt to finance the deal,\" so the debt is 200, and assuming it's still outstanding at exit (no repayment), then at exit, the company has EV = 10 * EBITDA_exit, and the equity value is EV - debt + cash. Wait, no: EV = equity value + debt - cash. So equity value = EV - debt + cash.\n\nYes, because EV = Equity + Debt - Cash. So Equity = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nSo exit equity value = (10 * EBITDA_exit) - Debt + Cash.\n\nBut the debt at exit is still 200 (assuming no repayment), and cash is 100. So:\n\nExit equity value = 10 * EBITDA_exit - 200 + 100 = 10 * EBITDA_exit - 100.\n\nEBITDA_exit = 50*(1+g)^5, so:\n\nExit equity value = 10*50*(1+g)^5 - 100 = 500*(1+g)^5 - 100.\n\nThe initial equity investment was 300 (since purchase price 500, 40% debt, so 60% equity: 0.6*500=300). Wait, 40% debt means 60% equity, so equity is 500*0.6=300. Yes.\n\nSo the IRR is calculated based on the initial equity investment of 300, and the exit equity value of 500*(1+g)^5 - 100.\n\nWe need this to equal a 25% IRR over 5 years. So:\n\n300 * (1 + 0.25)^5 = Exit equity value.\n\nCalculate 300*(1.25)^5. Let's compute that.\n\n1.25^5 = 1.25*1.25=1.5625; *1.25=1.953125; *1.25=2.44140625; *1.25=3.0517578125.\n\nSo 300 * 3.0517578125 ≈ 915.527.\n\nSo exit equity value should be ≈915.53.\n\nSet up equation:\n\n500*(1+g)^5 - 100 = 915.53\n\nSo 500*(1+g)^5 = 1015.53\n\n(1+g)^5 = 1015.53 / 500 ≈ 2.03106\n\nTake fifth root: (2.03106)^(1/5).\n\nCalculate 2.03106^(0.2). Let's see, 1.15^5 = 1.15*1.15=1.3225; *1.15=1.520875; *1.15=1.749006; *1.15≈2.011357. Close to 2.031.\n\n1.15^5 ≈ 2.011, so 2.031 is a bit higher. Let's compute 1.152^5.\n\n1.152^2 = 1.327104\n\n1.152^3 = 1.327104 * 1.152 ≈ 1.5285\n\n1.152^4 ≈ 1.5285 * 1.152 ≈ 1.760\n\n1.152^5 ≈ 1.760 * 1.152 ≈ 2.027. Close to 2.031.\n\nSo approximately 1.152, so 15.2% growth rate.\n\nBut let's do it more accurately.\n\nWe have (1+g)^5 = 2.03106\n\nTake natural log: ln(2.03106) ≈ 0.708\n\nDivide by 5: 0.708 /5 = 0.1416\n\nExponentiate: e^0.1416 ≈ 1.152, so 15.2%.\n\nAlternatively, using logarithm base 10:\n\nlog10(2.03106) ≈ 0.3077\n\n0.3077 /5 = 0.06154\n\n10^0.06154 ≈ 1.152 (since 10^0.06 ≈ 1.148, 10^0.062 ≈ 1.153)\n\nSo approximately 15.2%.\n\nBut let's check with exact calculation.\n\nLet me compute 1.15^5:\n\n1.15^1 = 1.15\n\n1.15^2 = 1.3225\n\n1.15^3 = 1.3225 * 1.15 = 1.520875\n\n1.15^4 = 1.520875 * 1.15 = 1.74900625\n\n1.15^5 = 1.74900625 * 1.15 = 2.0113571875\n\nWhich is 2.01136, but we need 2.03106.\n\nDifference: 2.03106 - 2.01136 = 0.0197.\n\nSo need a bit more than 15%.\n\nLet’s try 15.2%:\n\n1.152^5.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n1.152^2 = 1.152 * 1.152 = 1.327104\n\n1.152^3 = 1.327104 * 1.152 ≈ 1.327104 * 1.15 = 1.5261696 + 1.327104*0.002=0.002654208 → total ≈1.5288238\n\n1.152^4 = 1.5288238 * 1.152 ≈ 1.5288238*1.15 = 1.75814737 + 1.5288238*0.002=0.0030576476 → ≈1.761205\n\n1.152^5 = 1.761205 * 1.152 ≈ 1.761205*1.15 = 2.02538575 + 1.761205*0.002=0.00352241 → ≈2.0289\n\nStill a bit low. 2.0289 vs target 2.03106.\n\nTry 15.3%:\n\n1.153^2 = 1.153*1.153 = (1.15+0.003)^2 = 1.3225 + 2*1.15*0.003 + 0.000009 = 1.3225 + 0.0069 + 0.000009 = 1.329409\n\n1.153^3 = 1.329409 * 1.153 ≈ 1.329409*1.15 = 1.52882035 + 1.329409*0.003=0.003988227 → ≈1.532808577\n\n1.153^4 = 1.532808577 * 1.153 ≈ 1.532808577*1.15 = 1.762729863 + 1.532808577*0.003=0.0045984257 → ≈1.767328289\n\n1.153^5 = 1.767328289 * 1.153 ≈ 1.767328289*1.15 = 2.032427532 + 1.767328289*0.003=0.0053019848 → ≈2.0377\n\nThat's over 2.031. So between 15.2% and 15.3%.\n\nWe need (1+g)^5 = 2.03106.\n\nAt 15.2%, we had ~2.0289, at 15.3% ~2.0377.\n\nThe target is 2.03106.\n\nDifference between 15.2% and 15.3%: 0.0088 in the fifth power.\n\nWe need 2.03106 - 2.0289 = 0.00216.\n\nSo fraction = 0.00216 / 0.0088 ≈ 0.245.\n\nSo approximately 15.2% + 0.245*0.1% ≈ 15.2245%.\n\nSo roughly 15.2%.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects a rounded figure, like 15.2% or 15%.\n\nWait, let's check the calculation again.\n\nExit equity value = 500*(1+g)^5 - 100 = 300*(1.25)^5.\n\n300*(1.25)^5 = 300*3.0517578125 = 915.52734375.\n\nSo 500*(1+g)^5 = 915.52734375 + 100 = 1015.52734375.\n\nThus, (1+g)^5 = 1015.52734375 / 500 = 2.0310546875.\n\nSo (1+g) = (2.0310546875)^(1/5).\n\nUsing a calculator for fifth root:\n\n2.0310546875^(0.2).\n\nLet me use logarithms.\n\nln(2.0310546875) = 0.7085 (since ln(2)=0.6931, ln(2.031)= approx 0.7085).\n\n0.7085 /5 = 0.1417.\n\ne^0.1417 ≈ 1.152 (since e^0.14=1.15027, e^0.142=1.1525).\n\nSo 1.152, so 15.2%.\n\nTherefore, the required annual revenue growth rate is approximately 15.2%.\n\nBut let's confirm if all steps are correct.\n\nInitial EBITDA: 50, margin 20%, so revenue 250. Correct.\n\nPurchase price: 10x EBITDA = 500. Debt 40%: 200, equity 300. Correct.\n\nAfter 5 years, EBITDA = 50*(1+g)^5. Exit EV = 10x EBITDA = 500*(1+g)^5.\n\nCash at exit: 100. So equity value = EV - debt + cash = 500*(1+g)^5 - 200 + 100 = 500*(1+g)^5 - 100. Correct.\n\nIRR: initial equity 300, exit equity 500*(1+g)^5 - 100 = 300*(1.25)^5.\n\n300*(1.25)^5 = 300*3.0517578125 = 915.527.\n\nSo 500*(1+g)^5 = 915.527 + 100 = 1015.527.\n\n(1+g)^5 = 1015.527 / 500 = 2.03105.\n\nFifth root of 2.03105 is approximately 1.152, so 15.2%.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the answer should be 15.2%.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:15.2%",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the question is: If a customer buys a $75 Starbucks gift card, what's the immediate impact on Starbucks' cash flow before the card is used? The options are cash inflow, cash outflow, or no change.\n\nHmm. First, I need to recall how gift cards work in terms of accounting. When a customer purchases a gift card, they pay Starbucks upfront. So, Starbucks receives cash from the customer at the time of purchase. That means Starbucks gets the $75 in cash right away. \n\nBut wait, the question specifies \"before the card is used.\" So, the customer hasn't used the card yet; they just bought it. So, Starbucks has the cash from the sale of the gift card. That should be a cash inflow because Starbucks is receiving money. \n\nWait, but sometimes people get confused with gift cards because they're like a liability until the card is used. But the question is about cash flow, not the accounting entry. Cash flow is about actual cash moving in or out. When the customer pays for the gift card, Starbucks gets the cash immediately. So, that's a cash inflow. The fact that the gift card hasn't been used yet doesn't affect the cash flow at the time of sale. The liability (the obligation to provide goods/services later) is a separate accounting item, but the cash flow is still an inflow when the money is received.\n\nSo, the immediate impact is a cash inflow. The answer should be cash inflow. Let me double-check. If someone buys a gift card, Starbucks gets the cash right away. So yes, cash inflow. The usage of the card later would be when they spend it, but the question is about before it's used. So the purchase of the gift card itself is the cash inflow. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer is cash inflow.\n</think>\n\nWhen a customer purchases a $75 Starbucks gift card, Starbucks receives cash immediately from the customer. This transaction represents a cash inflow because Starbucks has received payment before the card is redeemed. The liability (to provide goods/services later) does not affect the immediate cash flow impact.\n\n<answer>:cash inflow",

      "question": "Suppose you buy a $75 Starbucks gift card, then spend the entire balance on drinks. What happens to Starbucks's cash flow at the moment you use that $75 (cash inflow, cash outflow, or no change)?",
      "ground_truth": "No change",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this Starbucks gift card question. So, the scenario is: I buy a $75 Starbucks gift card, then spend the entire balance on drinks. The question is asking what happens to Starbucks's cash flow when I use that $75.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how gift cards work in terms of cash flow. When I purchase a gift card from Starbucks, say at a store or online, I'm paying Starbucks cash upfront. So at that moment, Starbucks receives $75 in cash. That's a cash inflow for Starbucks because they're getting money from me before I actually use the card.\n\nNow, when I use the gift card to buy drinks, I'm redeeming the value of the card. But the key point here is that Starbucks already received the $75 when I bought the gift card. So when I spend the $75 on drinks, Starbucks isn't receiving any new cash. They're just using the pre-paid amount they already have. \n\nSo, the initial purchase of the gift card creates a cash inflow for Starbucks. Then, when I use the gift card, it's not a new cash transaction. The cash was already in Starbucks's hands when I bought the card. Therefore, at the moment I use the $75 on drinks, there's no additional cash flow—it's just a transfer of the existing prepaid amount. \n\nWait, but the question says \"at the moment you use that $75.\" So when I present the gift card to buy drinks, Starbucks is using the $75 they already received. So no new cash is coming in or going out at that moment. The cash flow change already happened when I bought the gift card. \n\nSo, the answer should be that there's no change in Starbucks's cash flow at the moment of using the gift card. The cash inflow occurred when the gift card was purchased, not when it was redeemed. Therefore, the cash flow doesn't change when I spend the balance; it's already accounted for.\n</think>\n\nWhen you purchase a $75 Starbucks gift card, Starbucks records a cash inflow of $75 immediately. When you later redeem the gift card for drinks, Starbucks uses the pre-paid cash it already received. No new cash is exchanged at the time of redemption, so there is no additional cash flow impact.\n\n<answer>:no change",

      "question": "Company X trades at $40 per share, owns 100 shares in total, and earns $200 of net income. Company Y trades at $30 per share, has 50 shares outstanding, and generates $50 in net income. X acquires Y entirely by issuing new shares. Is this deal accretive or dilutive to Company X?",
      "ground_truth": "Dilutive",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is whether Company X's acquisition of Company Y by issuing new shares is accretive or dilutive. Hmm, accretive means that after the acquisition, the earnings per share (EPS) of Company X increases, while dilutive would mean EPS decreases. Right.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current EPS for Company X before the acquisition. Company X has $200 net income and 100 shares outstanding. So EPS is net income divided by shares. That would be $200 / 100 = $2.00 per share.\n\nNow, Company Y has $50 net income and 50 shares. But since X is acquiring Y entirely by issuing new shares, I need to figure out how many new shares X will issue. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the exchange ratio. Hmm, maybe I need to assume that the acquisition is done at the market price? Wait, but the question says \"acquires Y entirely by issuing new shares.\" So probably, X is issuing shares to buy all of Y's shares. But how many shares does Y have? Y has 50 shares outstanding. So X needs to issue enough shares to buy those 50 shares. But at what price? The market price of Y is $30 per share. So the total value of Y is 50 shares * $30 = $1,500. So X would issue new shares worth $1,500. But what's the price per share for X's new shares? Wait, the problem doesn't specify the price at which X issues new shares. Wait, maybe it's assumed that X issues shares at its own market price of $40 per share. That's a common assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo, to acquire Y, X needs to pay $30 per share for Y's 50 shares, so total cost is 50 * $30 = $1,500. If X issues new shares at $40 each, then the number of new shares issued would be $1,500 / $40 = 37.5 shares. Wait, but shares are whole numbers, but maybe we can use fractions for calculation purposes.\n\nSo, after the acquisition, X's total shares outstanding would be original 100 + new 37.5 = 137.5 shares.\n\nNow, the combined net income would be X's $200 plus Y's $50, so $250.\n\nThen, the new EPS would be $250 / 137.5 ≈ $1.818 per share.\n\nOriginal EPS was $2.00. So the new EPS is lower, meaning it's dilutive.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nOriginal EPS for X: $200 / 100 = $2.00.\n\nAfter acquisition, total income: 200 + 50 = 250.\n\nNumber of shares: 100 + (50 * 30 / 40). Wait, why 30/40? Because Y's shares are priced at $30, but X is issuing at $40. So the number of new shares is (value of Y) / X's share price. Value of Y is 50 shares * $30 = $1,500. So new shares = 1500 / 40 = 37.5. So total shares 100 + 37.5 = 137.5.\n\nEPS = 250 / 137.5 = 1.818..., which is less than 2.00. So yes, dilutive.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use the earnings of Y divided by the number of shares X issues. Wait, but I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nAnother way: The earnings per share of Y is $50 / 50 = $1.00 per share. X's EPS is $2.00. Since Y's EPS is lower than X's, acquiring Y would dilute X's EPS. But wait, that's a simpler way. If the target's EPS is lower than the acquirer's, then the acquisition is dilutive. But this is a rough way. However, in this case, Y's EPS is $1.00, which is less than X's $2.00, so it's dilutive. But I should confirm with the calculation.\n\nYes, the calculation shows EPS goes from $2.00 to ~$1.82, so dilutive.\n\nWait, but let me check if the acquisition is done by issuing shares at Y's price or X's price. The problem says \"acquires Y entirely by issuing new shares.\" So X is issuing its own shares to buy Y. So the number of shares X issues would be based on X's share price. So the value of Y is 50 shares * $30 = $1,500. X's share price is $40, so X issues 1500 / 40 = 37.5 shares. So total shares after acquisition: 100 + 37.5 = 137.5. Combined income: 200 + 50 = 250. EPS: 250 / 137.5 = 1.818..., which is less than 2.00. So dilutive.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be dilutive.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the acquisition is accretive or dilutive, compare the pre- and post-acquisition earnings per share (EPS).\n\n- **Pre-acquisition EPS for X**:  \n  Net income = $200, Shares outstanding = 100  \n  EPS = $200 / 100 = **$2.00**\n\n- **Post-acquisition EPS**:  \n  - Combined net income = $200 (X) + $50 (Y) = **$250**  \n  - Shares issued to acquire Y:  \n    Value of Y = 50 shares × $30 = $1,500  \n    Shares issued = $1,500 / $40 (X's share price) = **37.5 shares**  \n  - Total shares outstanding = 100 + 37.5 = **137.5**  \n  - Post-acquisition EPS = $250 / 137.5 ≈ **$1.82**\n\nSince $1.82 < $2.00, the acquisition is **dilutive**.\n\n<answer>:dilutive",

      "question": "A firm has a P/E of 12x, a borrowing rate of 5%, and a D/E of 4x. Based on these figures, is the cost of equity or debt cheaper?",
      "ground_truth": "Cost of Debt",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is whether the cost of equity or debt is cheaper for a firm with a P/E of 12x, a borrowing rate of 5%, and a D/E of 4x.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these terms means. The P/E ratio is the price-to-earnings ratio, which is the market price per share divided by earnings per share. But how does that relate to the cost of equity? Hmm. The cost of equity isn't directly given by the P/E ratio. Wait, maybe there's a way to estimate it. I remember that the inverse of the P/E ratio can sometimes be related to the earnings yield, which is earnings per share divided by price per share. So if P/E is 12, the earnings yield would be 1/12 ≈ 8.33%. But is the earnings yield the same as the cost of equity? I think in some contexts, especially for valuation, the earnings yield might be compared to the cost of equity. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.\n\nWait, the question is about comparing the cost of equity versus the cost of debt. The cost of debt is given as the borrowing rate of 5%. So the cost of debt is 5%. Now, the cost of equity is what we need to figure out. The D/E ratio is 4x, which is debt-to-equity of 4, meaning the firm has a lot of debt relative to equity. But how does that help?\n\nWait, maybe the P/E ratio can be used to estimate the cost of equity. Let me think. The P/E ratio is related to the earnings yield. If the P/E is 12, then the earnings yield is 1/12 ≈ 8.33%. If the firm's earnings yield is higher than the cost of debt, then maybe equity is more expensive? Wait, but the cost of equity is the return that shareholders require. If the earnings yield (which is like the return on equity) is 8.33%, then the cost of equity might be around that. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the P/E ratio can be used in the context of the dividend discount model or something else. But the problem doesn't mention dividends. Hmm. Let's see. Another approach: the cost of equity can be estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), but we don't have beta or risk-free rate here. So that's probably not the way to go.\n\nWait, the question might be tricking me. The borrowing rate is 5%, which is the cost of debt. The cost of equity is typically higher than the cost of debt because equity is riskier. But the question is asking based on the given figures. So maybe the P/E ratio is a red herring, and the answer is straightforward: cost of debt (5%) is cheaper than cost of equity, which is usually higher. But the problem gives a D/E of 4x, which is very high. High debt might increase the cost of equity due to higher financial risk, but the cost of debt is still lower than equity. Wait, but the borrowing rate is 5%, so cost of debt is 5%. If the cost of equity is higher than 5%, then debt is cheaper. But how do we know the cost of equity?\n\nWait, maybe the P/E ratio can be used to find the cost of equity. Let's recall that the P/E ratio is related to the earnings yield. If the earnings yield is 1/P.E, so 1/12 ≈ 8.33%. If the earnings yield is the return that investors expect, then the cost of equity might be around 8.33%. So if the cost of equity is approximately 8.33% and the cost of debt is 5%, then debt is cheaper. But is that correct?\n\nWait, the earnings yield (E/P) is the inverse of P/E. So if P/E is 12, E/P is 1/12 ≈ 8.33%. The earnings yield is sometimes used as a rough estimate of the cost of equity, especially in some valuation models. So if that's the case, then cost of equity ≈ 8.33%, which is higher than the cost of debt of 5%. Therefore, debt is cheaper.\n\nBut I should check if there's another way. The D/E ratio is 4x, which is debt-to-equity. So if D/E is 4, then the firm has 4 times as much debt as equity. But how does that affect the cost of equity? Higher leverage usually increases the cost of equity because of higher risk. But the question is not asking for the exact cost of equity, just whether it's cheaper than debt. Since the cost of debt is given as 5%, and the cost of equity is estimated via P/E as ~8.33%, then debt is cheaper.\n\nWait, but is the earnings yield equal to the cost of equity? I think in some contexts, like when using the earnings yield as a proxy for the required return, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me verify. For example, if a company has a P/E of 10, the earnings yield is 10%, which might be compared to the cost of equity. If the cost of equity is higher than the earnings yield, the stock is undervalued, but that's a different context. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to know that cost of debt is usually lower than cost of equity, so regardless of the numbers, debt is cheaper. But the question gives specific numbers, so maybe they want me to calculate something. Wait, the borrowing rate is 5%, which is the cost of debt. The cost of equity isn't directly given, but maybe the P/E ratio can be used to find it. Let's think again.\n\nThe P/E ratio is Price/Earnings. If we assume that the earnings are the same as the return on equity, but I'm not sure. Wait, another angle: the cost of equity can be approximated by the earnings yield (E/P) when the company is in a stable growth phase. So if P/E is 12, then E/P is 1/12 ≈ 8.33%, so cost of equity ≈ 8.33%. Since 8.33% > 5%, debt is cheaper.\n\nYes, that seems to be the intended approach. So the answer would be that debt is cheaper.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The D/E ratio is 4x. Does that affect anything? If the firm has a high D/E, the cost of equity might be higher, but we already estimated it as 8.33%, which is higher than 5%. So even with high leverage, the cost of equity is still higher than the cost of debt. So the conclusion remains that debt is cheaper.\n\nSo the final answer should be that the cost of debt is cheaper, so the answer is \"debt\" or \"cost of debt\".\n</think>\n\nThe P/E ratio of 12x implies an earnings yield of approximately 8.33% (1/12), which is a rough estimate of the cost of equity. The borrowing rate (cost of debt) is given as 5%. Since 5% < 8.33%, the cost of debt is cheaper than the cost of equity.\n\n<answer>:debt",

      "question": "A corporation's WACC is 9%, its after-tax cost of debt is 5%, and its debt-to-equity ratio is 60%. What is its cost of equity?",
      "ground_truth": "10.56%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the cost of equity for a corporation given its WACC, after-tax cost of debt, and debt-to-equity ratio. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that WACC stands for Weighted Average Cost of Capital. The formula for WACC is:\n\nWACC = (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rd * (1 - Tc)\n\nWhere:\n- E is the market value of equity\n- D is the market value of debt\n- V = E + D (total value of the firm)\n- Re is the cost of equity\n- Rd is the cost of debt\n- Tc is the corporate tax rate\n\nBut wait, the problem gives the after-tax cost of debt as 5%. So Rd*(1-Tc) = 5%. That means we don't need to worry about the tax rate separately because it's already factored in.\n\nThe debt-to-equity ratio is given as 60%. Wait, debt-to-equity ratio is D/E = 0.6. So D = 0.6E.\n\nNow, to find the weights for WACC. The weights are based on the proportion of debt and equity in the total capital structure. So V = D + E = 0.6E + E = 1.6E.\n\nTherefore, the weight of debt (D/V) is 0.6E / 1.6E = 0.6 / 1.6 = 0.375 or 37.5%.\n\nThe weight of equity (E/V) is E / 1.6E = 1 / 1.6 = 0.625 or 62.5%.\n\nGiven that WACC is 9%, after-tax cost of debt is 5%, so Rd*(1-Tc) = 5%.\n\nPlugging into the WACC formula:\n\n0.09 = (0.625) * Re + (0.375) * 0.05\n\nLet me compute the debt part first: 0.375 * 0.05 = 0.01875\n\nSo, 0.09 = 0.625 * Re + 0.01875\n\nSubtract 0.01875 from both sides: 0.09 - 0.01875 = 0.625 * Re\n\n0.07125 = 0.625 * Re\n\nThen, Re = 0.07125 / 0.625 = 0.114\n\nSo, 11.4%.\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again.\n\n0.375 * 0.05 = 0.01875. Correct.\n\n0.09 - 0.01875 = 0.07125. Correct.\n\n0.07125 divided by 0.625. Let's compute that.\n\n0.07125 / 0.625. Let's see, 0.625 is 5/8, so dividing by 5/8 is multiplying by 8/5.\n\n0.07125 * 8 = 0.57, then 0.57 / 5 = 0.114. So 11.4%.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the cost of equity is 11.4%.\n\nWait, the debt-to-equity ratio is 60%, which is D/E = 0.6. So D = 0.6E. Then total capital V = D + E = 1.6E. So the weights are D/V = 0.6/1.6 = 0.375, E/V = 1/1.6 = 0.625. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems right. So the answer should be 11.4%.\n</think>\n\nTo find the cost of equity (Re), use the WACC formula:\n\nWACC = (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rd*(1-Tc)\n\nGiven:\n- WACC = 9% = 0.09\n- After-tax cost of debt (Rd*(1-Tc)) = 5% = 0.05\n- Debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) = 60% = 0.6\n\nCalculate weights:\n- D = 0.6E\n- V = D + E = 0.6E + E = 1.6E\n- D/V = 0.6/1.6 = 0.375\n- E/V = 1/1.6 = 0.625\n\nSubstitute into WACC formula:\n0.09 = (0.625 * Re) + (0.375 * 0.05)\n\nSolve for Re:\n0.09 = 0.625Re + 0.01875  \n0.07125 = 0.625Re  \nRe = 0.07125 / 0.625 = 0.114 = 11.4%\n\n<answer>:11.4%",

They're raising a 30 million term loan to finance a 60 million acquisition. The question is how this affects the enterprise value.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what enterprise value (EV) is. EV is typically calculated as Equity Value plus Debt minus Cash. So, EV = Equity + Debt - Cash. But wait, sometimes it's also Equity Value plus Net Debt (Debt minus Cash). Either way, the formula should be consistent.\n\nLet me confirm the standard formula. Yes, Enterprise Value = Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash. So, the components here are equity, debt, and cash.\n\nNow, the firm's current situation: Equity is 200M, Debt is 100M, Cash is 70M. So current EV would be 200 + 100 - 70 = 230 million.\n\nBut they're raising a 30 million term loan. A term loan is a type of debt, so debt increases by 30 million.

Hmm, maybe they're using the 30 million loan plus some other funds? But the question says \"raises a 30 million term loan to finance a 60 million acquisition.\" So perhaps the acquisition cost is 60 million, but they're only taking a 30 million loan, so maybe they're using cash or equity for the rest? Wait, but the question is about how the enterprise value is affected. Let's think.\n\nEnterprise value is about the value of the company's operations, not the financing. But when they take on new debt, that affects the debt component. However, the acquisition itself might affect the value, but the question doesn't specify if the acquisition is accretive or dilutive. Wait, but the question is about how the enterprise value is affected by the financing, not the acquisition's impact on value. Wait, maybe the acquisition is just a transaction, but the enterprise value calculation would adjust for the new debt and cash.\n\nWait, when they raise a 30 million term loan, they get 30 million in cash. So cash increases by 30 million. But they're using that cash to finance a 60 million acquisition. Wait, but if they're raising a 30 million loan, they get 30 million cash, but the acquisition is 60 million. So maybe they're using the 30 million loan plus 30 million from existing cash? But the problem states \"raises a 30 million term loan to finance a 60 million acquisition.\" So perhaps the loan is part of the financing, but the acquisition cost is 60 million, so they might be using the 30 million loan plus 30 million from other sources (like existing cash). But the problem doesn't specify where the other 30 million comes from. However, for enterprise value calculation, we need to track changes in debt and cash.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\nOriginal:\n\nEquity: 200M\n\nDebt: 100M\n\nCash: 70M\n\nEV = 200 + 100 - 70 = 230M\n\nNow, they raise a 30M term loan. So debt increases by 30M (new debt = 130M). The loan proceeds are cash, so cash increases by 30M (new cash = 70 + 30 = 100M).\n\nBut they are using this to finance a 60M acquisition. Wait, the acquisition cost is 60M, so they need to spend 60M. If they have 30M from the loan, they might use 30M from existing cash. So cash would decrease by 60M (30M from loan proceeds and 30M from existing cash). Wait, but the loan is raised first, so cash increases by 30M, then they spend 60M on acquisition, so cash decreases by 60M. So net change in cash: +30M (from loan) -60M (acquisition) = -30M. So new cash = 70 +30 -60 = 40M.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"raises a 30 million term loan to finance a 60 million acquisition.\" So the 30 million loan is part of the financing, but the total acquisition cost is 60 million. So perhaps they are using the 30 million loan plus 30 million from existing cash. So cash would go from 70M to 70 -30 = 40M (since they use 30M cash), but they also received 30M from the loan, so cash is 70 +30 -30 = 70M? Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nWhen they raise the loan, they get 30M cash. So cash becomes 70 +30 = 100M. Then they spend 60M on acquisition, so cash becomes 100 -60 = 40M. So net cash change: 40 -70 = -30M.\n\nDebt increases by 30M (from 100 to 130).\n\nSo new EV = Equity + New Debt - New Cash.\n\nBut wait, does the acquisition affect equity? If they're acquiring another company, the equity value might change, but the question doesn't mention any change in equity value. The problem states the firm's equity is 200 million, but if they're acquiring another company, perhaps they're using the cash and loan to pay for it, so the equity value might not change immediately. Wait, but enterprise value is a measure of the company's value, not the equity. So if they acquire another company, the enterprise value would increase by the value of the acquisition, but the problem doesn't specify if the acquisition is at fair value or if it's a purchase. However, the question is about how the financing affects EV, not the acquisition's impact. Wait, but the acquisition is part of the transaction. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the key here is that enterprise value is calculated as equity + debt - cash. The acquisition itself, if it's a purchase, would be reflected in the assets, but EV is a valuation metric. However, the question is about the effect of the financing (the loan) on EV. So perhaps the acquisition is irrelevant to the EV calculation because EV is based on the company's capital structure, not the acquisition's value. Wait, but if they're using the loan to finance the acquisition, the cash used would affect the cash balance, which affects EV.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nOriginal EV = Equity + Debt - Cash = 200 + 100 -70 = 230.\n\nAfter raising the loan:\n\n- Debt increases by 30 (to 130).\n\n- Cash increases by 30 (from the loan), but then they spend 60 on acquisition, so cash decreases by 60. So net cash change: +30 -60 = -30. So new cash = 70 -30 = 40.\n\nTherefore, new EV = 200 + 130 -40 = 290.\n\nWait, but equity is still 200? Because the acquisition might not affect equity immediately. If they're using debt and cash to acquire another company, the equity value might not change unless they issue new equity. But the problem states they're raising a term loan (debt), so equity remains 200.\n\nSo original EV: 230.\n\nNew EV: 200 + 130 -40 = 290.\n\nSo EV increased by 60 million.\n\nBut wait, why? Because they took on more debt (30M) but also spent cash (30M net), so the net effect on EV is debt up 30, cash down 30, so EV increases by 30 +30 =60? Wait, EV = Equity + Debt - Cash. So change in EV = change in Debt - change in Cash.\n\nChange in Debt: +30.\n\nChange in Cash: -30 (from 70 to 40).\n\nSo change in EV = +30 - (-30) = +60. So EV increases by 60 million.\n\nBut wait, the acquisition cost is 60 million. So the company is acquiring an asset worth 60 million, which would increase the company's value by 60 million. But in terms of EV calculation, the EV should reflect the value of the assets. However, the standard EV formula doesn't include the acquisition cost directly; it's based on the capital structure. Wait, but if they're using debt and cash to acquire, the EV should adjust for the new debt and cash.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the acquisition is not reflected in the EV calculation because EV is a snapshot of the company's value before the acquisition. But the question is about how the financing affects EV, so the act of taking the loan and using it for the acquisition changes the debt and cash, thus changing EV.\n\nWait, another way: when you take a loan, you increase debt and cash. Then, when you spend the cash on an acquisition, you decrease cash but increase assets (the acquired company's assets). However, enterprise value is calculated as equity + debt - cash, which is a measure of the company's value excluding cash. So if you spend cash on an acquisition, the cash decreases, but the assets increase. However, EV is not adjusted for the acquisition's value; it's based on the capital structure. Wait, no. Actually, EV is a measure of the company's value, so if the acquisition is a new asset, the EV should increase by the value of the acquisition. But the problem doesn't specify if the acquisition is at fair value or if it's a purchase. However, the question is about the effect of the financing (the loan) on EV, not the acquisition's impact. So perhaps the key is that the loan increases debt, and the cash used for acquisition decreases cash, so the net effect on EV is debt up 30, cash down 30, so EV up 60.\n\nWait, let's verify with numbers.\n\nOriginal:\n\nDebt: 100\n\nCash: 70\n\nEV = 200 + 100 -70 = 230.\n\nAfter:\n\nDebt: 100 +30 =130\n\nCash: 70 +30 (from loan) -60 (spent on acquisition) =40\n\nEV = 200 +130 -40 = 290.\n\nSo EV increased by 60 million.\n\nTherefore, the enterprise value is affected by an increase of 60 million.\n\nBut wait, why is the acquisition cost 60 million? If they spent 60 million on acquisition, but the cash decreased by 30 million (from 70 to 40), that means they used 30 million from the loan and 30 million from existing cash. So the net cash outflow is 30 million (since they got 30 million from the loan but spent 60 million total). So cash decreased by 30 million (70 to 40), debt increased by 30 million. So the change in EV is (change in debt) - (change in cash) = +30 - (-30) = +60. So EV increases by 60.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be that enterprise value increases by 60 million.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way. Sometimes, when you take a loan to finance an acquisition, the acquisition's value is added to the company's assets, so EV should increase by the acquisition value. But in this case, the acquisition is 60 million, so EV should increase by 60 million. Which matches the calculation above.\n\nSo the answer is that enterprise value increases by 60 million.\n</think>\n\nThe firm's enterprise value (EV) is calculated as Equity + Debt - Cash. Initially, EV = 200 + 100 - 70 = 230 million. After raising a 30 million term loan (increasing Debt to 130 million) and using the proceeds plus 30 million from existing cash to finance a 60 million acquisition (reducing Cash to 40 million), the new EV = 200 + 130 - 40 = 290 million. The change in EV is 290 - 230 = 60 million.\n\n<answer>:60 million",

      "question": "A firm has 200 million of equity, 100 million of debt, and 70 million of cash. The company raises a 30 million term loan to finance a 60 million acquisition. How is its equity value affected?",
      "ground_truth": "30M increase",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this financial question. So, the firm has 200 million in equity, 100 million in debt, and 70 million in cash. They're raising a 30 million term loan to finance a 60 million acquisition. The question is how this affects the equity value.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how acquisitions and financing work. When a company acquires another company, the acquisition cost is usually paid from cash or by taking on debt. Here, they're using a term loan of 30 million, but the acquisition is 60 million. Wait, that doesn't add up. If they're raising a 30 million loan, but the acquisition is 60 million, maybe they're using some cash as well? But the problem says they're raising the loan to finance the acquisition. Hmm.\n\nWait, the company has 70 million in cash. So maybe they're using the cash plus the new loan. Let's break it down. The acquisition cost is 60 million. They have 70 million cash, so they could use 60 million from cash, but they're taking a 30 million loan. Wait, that might not be right. If they take a 30 million loan, that's new debt. But the acquisition is 60 million. So perhaps they're using the 30 million loan plus 30 million from cash? But the problem states they're raising a 30 million term loan to finance the 60 million acquisition. Maybe the 30 million loan is part of the financing, but where's the rest?\n\nWait, maybe the question is simpler. Let's think about the balance sheet. Equity is assets minus liabilities. Initially, the company has equity of 200M, debt 100M, cash 70M. So total assets would be equity + debt? Wait, no. Wait, equity is shareholders' equity, which is assets minus liabilities. So if they have 200M equity, 100M debt (liabilities), then total assets would be 200M + 100M = 300M. But they also have 70M cash. Wait, maybe the cash is part of the assets. So assets = cash + other assets. But the problem states \"200 million of equity, 100 million of debt, and 70 million of cash.\" So equity is 200, debt is 100, cash is 70. So total assets would be equity + debt = 300, but cash is part of assets. So maybe the 70M cash is included in the assets. So the balance sheet is:\n\nAssets: Cash 70M + Other Assets (let's say X)\nLiabilities: Debt 100M\nEquity: 200M\n\nSo 70 + X = 100 + 200 → X = 230M. So other assets are 230M.\n\nNow, they raise a 30M term loan. So new debt is 100 + 30 = 130M. They use this to finance a 60M acquisition. Wait, but the loan is 30M, so they get 30M cash from the loan. But the acquisition is 60M. So they need to pay 60M for the acquisition. So they take 30M from the loan and 30M from their existing cash. So cash would decrease by 30M (from 70M to 40M), and debt increases by 30M (to 130M). But the acquisition itself would be an asset. Wait, when you acquire another company, you're buying assets (or equity), so the acquisition cost would be added to assets. So the 60M acquisition would be recorded as an asset (like goodwill or other assets), but the cash used to pay for it would decrease cash.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"finance a 60 million acquisition.\" So the company is spending 60 million to acquire another company. They're raising a 30 million loan, so they get 30 million in cash from the loan, and they use 30 million from their existing cash. So cash goes from 70M to 70 - 30 = 40M, and they receive 30M from the loan, so cash increases by 30M, net change in cash is 0? Wait, no. When they take a loan, they get cash. So the loan proceeds are +30M cash. Then they spend 60M on the acquisition, so cash decreases by 60M. So net cash change: +30M (from loan) -60M (acquisition) = -30M. So cash goes from 70M to 40M.\n\nBut the acquisition itself is an asset. So the company now has the acquired assets (60M) plus the existing assets. Wait, but the 60M is the cost of the acquisition, so it's added to assets. So total assets would be previous assets (300M: 200 equity + 100 debt) plus the 60M acquisition asset, but they used cash to pay for it. Wait, no. The acquisition cost is paid with cash (or debt proceeds), so the cash is reduced by 60M, but the acquisition is recorded as an asset. So the net effect on assets: -60M cash +60M acquisition asset = no change in total assets. But they also took a loan, so they have +30M cash from the loan, but then spent 60M, so net cash change is -30M, but the acquisition asset is +60M. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet's think in terms of the balance sheet. Before the transaction:\n\nAssets: Cash 70M + Other Assets (230M) = 300M\nLiabilities: Debt 100M\nEquity: 200M\n\nAfter raising the 30M loan:\n\nAssets: Cash increases by 30M (from loan) → 70 +30 = 100M\nLiabilities: Debt increases by 30M → 130M\n\nThen, they use 60M to acquire the company. So they pay 60M in cash, so cash decreases by 60M → 100 -60 = 40M. The acquisition is recorded as an asset (say, goodwill or other assets), so assets increase by 60M. So total assets now: 40M cash + 230M other assets +60M acquisition = 330M.\n\nLiabilities: 130M\nEquity: ?\n\nTotal assets = liabilities + equity → 330 = 130 + equity → equity = 200M.\n\nWait, so equity remains 200M? But that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, the acquisition cost is paid with cash (from the loan proceeds and existing cash), so the cash is reduced, but the asset is added. So the net change in assets is zero (since you pay cash for an asset), but the loan increases liabilities. Wait, let's see:\n\nBefore:\n\nAssets: 300M (70 cash + 230 other)\nLiabilities: 100M\nEquity: 200M\n\nAfter loan:\n\nAssets: 300 +30 = 330 (cash 100, other 230)\nLiabilities: 130\nEquity: 200\n\nThen, pay 60M for acquisition:\n\nAssets: 330 -60 (cash) +60 (acquisition asset) = 330\nLiabilities: 130\nEquity: 200\n\nSo equity remains the same. But wait, the acquisition might not be recorded as an asset if it's a stock purchase, but typically, acquisitions are recorded as assets (goodwill, etc.), so the asset value increases. So the equity doesn't change because the asset increase offsets the cash decrease. But the debt increased by 30M, so liabilities increased by 30M, but assets also increased by 30M (from the loan), then the acquisition just swaps cash for another asset, so no net change. Wait, but the loan was used to finance the acquisition, so the 30M loan is part of the financing, but the acquisition cost is 60M. So they used 30M from the loan and 30M from cash. So cash goes down by 30M (from 70 to 40), and the acquisition asset is 60M. So total assets: 40 cash + 230 other +60 acquisition = 330. Liabilities: 130. Equity: 330 -130 = 200. So equity remains 200M.\n\nBut wait, the question is about how equity value is affected. If equity remains the same, then it's not affected. But maybe I'm missing something. Wait, another angle: when a company takes on debt to acquire another company, the equity value might change if the acquisition is accretive or dilutive, but the question doesn't provide any information about the earnings or value of the acquired company. So we have to assume that the acquisition is priced at fair value, so the equity value remains the same.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"how is its equity value affected?\" If the equity value is calculated as assets minus liabilities, and we've shown that it remains 200M, then the answer is no change. But let's check again.\n\nOriginal equity: 200M.\n\nAfter the transaction:\n\nTotal assets = (70M cash - 60M paid for acquisition +30M loan) + other assets + acquisition asset.\n\nWait, the 30M loan adds to cash, then 60M is spent, so cash is 70 +30 -60 = 40.\n\nOther assets remain 230.\n\nAcquisition asset is 60.\n\nTotal assets: 40 +230 +60 = 330.\n\nLiabilities: 100 +30 =130.\n\nEquity: 330 -130 =200. So yes, equity remains 200.\n\nTherefore, the equity value is not affected. So the answer is no change, or 0.\n\nBut the question says \"how is its equity value affected?\" So the answer should be that it remains the same, so no change. But the problem might be tricking us. Wait, another thought: when you take on debt, the equity value might be affected by the increased leverage, but in terms of book value, it's still the same. The question is probably asking about book equity, not market value. So book equity remains 200M.\n\nSo the answer is that equity value is unchanged, so the effect is 0.\n</think>\n\nThe firm initially has equity of $200 million. It raises a $30 million term loan (increasing debt by $30 million) and uses $60 million to finance an acquisition. The $30 million loan proceeds increase cash by $30 million, and $60 million is spent from cash (using $30 million from the loan and $30 million from existing cash), resulting in a net cash decrease of $30 million. The acquisition adds $60 million in assets (e.g., goodwill), offsetting the cash outflow. Total assets remain unchanged relative to the debt increase, so equity (assets - liabilities) stays at $200 million.\n\n<answer>:0",

      "question": "Imagine a business raises 60 million in new equity and immediately pays that amount as a dividend. What is the impact on its enterprise value?",
      "ground_truth": "stays the same",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the business raises 60 million in new equity and immediately pays that as a dividend. We need to find the impact on enterprise value.\n\nFirst, I remember that enterprise value (EV) is calculated as market capitalization plus debt minus cash. But wait, when a company issues new equity, they get cash. Then they pay that cash out as a dividend. So, the cash inflow from equity issuance is immediately offset by the dividend payment.\n\nLet me think step by step. When they raise 60 million in new equity, their cash increases by 60 million. But then they pay a 60 million dividend, so cash decreases by 60 million. So net effect on cash is zero. \n\nEnterprise value is typically market cap (which includes the new equity) plus debt minus cash. Wait, but when they issue new equity, the market cap increases by the amount raised. However, since they immediately pay it out as a dividend, the cash is gone. But does the dividend payment affect the market cap?\n\nWait, when a company pays a dividend, the stock price usually drops by the dividend amount on the ex-dividend date. So, the market cap would decrease by the dividend amount. But in this case, the company raised the equity and then paid it out as a dividend. So, the new equity issuance increases the market cap by 60 million, but the dividend payment would decrease the market cap by 60 million. So net effect on market cap is zero.\n\nBut enterprise value is market cap + debt - cash. Let's break it down. Before the transaction, let's say the company has some market cap (M), debt (D), and cash (C). EV = M + D - C.\n\nAfter raising 60 million equity: cash increases by 60 million (so new cash is C + 60), market cap increases by 60 million (new market cap is M + 60). Then they pay 60 million dividend: cash decreases by 60 million (back to C), and market cap decreases by 60 million (back to M). So the new EV would be (M) + D - C, which is the same as before. So the enterprise value remains unchanged.\n\nWait, but the dividend payment is from the new cash, so the cash was temporarily increased but then reduced. So the net cash position is the same. Therefore, EV doesn't change. The key point is that enterprise value is not affected by capital structure changes like equity issuance and dividend payments because it's a measure of the company's value excluding the effects of financing. So the answer should be no impact, or enterprise value remains the same.\n</think>\n\nThe business raises 60 million in new equity, increasing cash by 60 million. It then pays the entire amount as a dividend, reducing cash by 60 million. Enterprise value (EV) = Market Cap + Debt - Cash. The equity issuance increases Market Cap by 60 million, but the dividend payment decreases Market Cap by 60 million (as stock price adjusts). Cash remains unchanged net. Thus, EV is unaffected.\n\n<answer>:0",

The question is how this affects the firm's equity value.\n\nHmm, first, I need to recall some basic finance principles. When a company issues new equity, it's raising capital from shareholders. But in this case, they're raising 40 million through equity and then paying it all out as a dividend right away. \n\nWait, if they get 40 million from new shareholders (equity issuance), that would increase the company's cash and equity on the balance sheet. But then they distribute that same 40 million as a dividend. So, the cash goes out, and the equity value should adjust accordingly.\n\nLet me think step by step. When the firm issues new equity, say, by selling shares, they receive cash. So, their cash increases by 40 million, and their equity (shareholders' equity) also increases by 40 million. But then, when they pay a dividend of 40 million, they're reducing cash by 40 million and reducing retained earnings (which is part of equity) by 40 million. \n\nSo, the initial equity increase from the new issuance is offset by the dividend payment. The net effect on equity should be zero. Because the equity went up by 40 million when they raised the money, then down by 40 million when they paid the dividend. So, the equity value remains unchanged.\n\nWait, but I should make sure. Let's consider the balance sheet. Before any action, equity is, say, E. When they issue 40 million in equity, cash +40M, equity +40M. Then, paying a dividend: cash -40M, retained earnings (part of equity) -40M. So, equity was E +40M, then E +40M -40M = E. So, back to original equity value. Therefore, no change.\n\nAnother angle: the dividend is paid out of the newly raised funds, so the firm isn't using existing assets. The new shareholders get their money back immediately as a dividend. So, the firm's equity value doesn't change because the money raised is immediately returned. The net effect is that the firm's equity value remains the same as before the transaction.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be that the equity value remains unchanged.\n</think>\n\nThe firm raises 40 million in equity, increasing equity by 40 million. It then distributes the entire amount as a dividend, reducing equity by 40 million. The net effect on equity value is zero.\n\n<answer>:unchanged",

      "question": "A private equity group acquires a company with 200M of EBITDA at a 4x multiple, financing 50% with debt. In the fifth year, EBITDA has grown to 300M, and the firm exits at a 5x multiple. Across this period, 400M of debt was paid down, with no remaining surplus cash. What are the MOIC and the IRR of this investment?",
      "ground_truth": "3x MOIC, 25% IRR",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this private equity investment problem. So, the question is about calculating MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return) for a deal. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the acquisition details: The company has $200M EBITDA at a 4x multiple. The private equity group finances 50% with debt. So, the total enterprise value (EV) at acquisition is EBITDA multiplied by the multiple. That would be 200M * 4 = $800M. Since they're financing 50% with debt, the equity investment would be half of that. Wait, no—wait, the debt is 50% of the total purchase price. So, total EV is $800M, so debt is 50% of 800M, which is $400M. Therefore, equity invested is also $400M. Wait, but the question says \"financing 50% with debt,\" so yes, debt is 50% of the total, so equity is the other 50%. So initial equity investment is $400M.\n\nNow, in the fifth year, EBITDA has grown to $300M, and they exit at a 5x multiple. So exit EV is 300M * 5 = $1,500M. But they also paid down $400M of debt over the period. Wait, the problem states \"400M of debt was paid down, with no remaining surplus cash.\" So, the initial debt was $400M (since they financed 50% of 800M), and they paid down 400M, so the debt is now zero. So the exit proceeds would be the exit EV minus the remaining debt. But since they paid down all the debt (400M paid down from initial 400M), the remaining debt is zero. So the cash received at exit is the exit EV, which is $1,500M. Wait, but exit EV is the enterprise value, which is equity plus debt. Wait, no: Enterprise Value = Equity Value + Debt - Cash. But in this case, they have no surplus cash, so exit EV = Exit Equity Value + Remaining Debt. But since they paid down all debt, remaining debt is zero. So Exit Equity Value = Exit EV = $1,500M.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The exit EV is calculated as EBITDA * multiple, so 300M * 5 = 1,500M. This EV is the total value of the company, which includes debt. But when they exit, they pay off the remaining debt. However, the problem states that 400M of debt was paid down, and initial debt was 400M (since 50% of 800M is 400M), so they paid down all the debt. So at exit, there's no debt left. Therefore, the equity value received is equal to the exit EV, which is $1,500M.\n\nSo the equity investment was $400M (since they put in 50% of 800M), and they got back $1,500M. So MOIC is total proceeds divided by equity invested. So 1,500 / 400 = 3.75x. Wait, but let me check again. Wait, the initial equity investment: total EV is 800M, debt is 400M, so equity is 400M. Yes. Exit EV is 1,500M, and since all debt is paid off, the equity proceeds are 1,500M. So MOIC is 1,500 / 400 = 3.75.\n\nNow for IRR. IRR is the rate that makes the present value of cash flows equal to zero. The cash flows here are: initial investment of -400M at time 0, and then at year 5, a return of 1,500M. So we need to find the rate r such that 400 = 1,500 / (1 + r)^5. Solving for r.\n\nLet me compute that. So (1 + r)^5 = 1,500 / 400 = 3.75. Then 1 + r = 3.75^(1/5). Let's calculate that. 3.75 to the power of 0.2. Let's see, 3.75^(0.2). Let's approximate. 3.75 is about 3.75. Let's see, 1.3^5 = 1.3*1.3=1.69, *1.3=2.197, *1.3=2.856, *1.3=3.712. Oh, that's close to 3.75. So 1.3^5 ≈ 3.712, which is very close to 3.75. So the IRR is approximately 30% per year. Let me check with a calculator. 1.3^5 = 3.71293, so 3.75 / 3.71293 ≈ 1.0099, so maybe 30.1% or so. But for the purposes of this problem, it's probably expected to use the approximation or a calculator. But since it's a standard problem, maybe the answer is 30% IRR.\n\nWait, but let's confirm. Let's compute 3.75^(1/5). Let's take natural log: ln(3.75) ≈ 1.3217558. Divide by 5: 0.26435. Exponentiate: e^0.26435 ≈ 1.302. So approximately 30.2% IRR. So rounding to the nearest whole number, 30% IRR. But sometimes these problems expect a more precise answer. However, in finance, IRR is often rounded to the nearest whole number or one decimal. But given that 1.3^5 is 3.712, and 1.302^5 would be about 3.75, so 30.2% IRR. But maybe the problem expects 30% as the answer.\n\nWait, but let's check the exact calculation. Let's use the formula:\n\nIRR = (Exit Proceeds / Initial Equity)^(1/n) - 1\n\nSo (1500 / 400)^(1/5) - 1 = (3.75)^(0.2) - 1.\n\nCalculating 3.75^0.2:\n\nUsing a calculator, 3.75^0.2 ≈ e^(ln(3.75)/5) ≈ e^(1.3217558/5) ≈ e^0.26435 ≈ 1.302, so 30.2% IRR.\n\nBut in many cases, especially in exams or problems, they might round it to 30% or 30.2%. However, the problem might expect the exact calculation. But since the question says \"final answer in correct financial format,\" probably MOIC is 3.75x and IRR is approximately 30%.\n\nWait, but let's make sure about the MOIC. MOIC is total proceeds divided by equity invested. So 1,500 / 400 = 3.75. So MOIC is 3.75x.\n\nFor IRR, the calculation is correct. So the answer should be MOIC: 3.75x, IRR: ~30%.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other factor I missed. The problem says \"400M of debt was paid down, with no remaining surplus cash.\" So initial debt was 400M (since 50% of 800M), paid down 400M, so debt is zero. So exit proceeds are indeed 1,500M. So equity proceeds are 1,500M. So yes, MOIC is 1,500 / 400 = 3.75.\n\nAnother check: sometimes people confuse EV with equity. But in this case, since debt is paid off, the equity value at exit is equal to EV. So that's correct.\n\nSo final answers: MOIC is 3.75x, IRR is approximately 30.2%, which is often rounded to 30% in such contexts. But maybe the problem expects the precise value. However, in the absence of a calculator, 30% is standard.\n\nWait, but let's see if the problem expects the IRR to be calculated with more precision. Let's compute 1.3^5 = 3.71293, 1.302^5: let's compute 1.302^2 = 1.695204, then ^3 = 1.695204 * 1.302 ≈ 2.207, ^4 ≈ 2.207 * 1.302 ≈ 2.873, ^5 ≈ 2.873 * 1.302 ≈ 3.74. So 1.302^5 ≈ 3.74, which is very close to 3.75. So IRR is approximately 30.2%, which would be 30.2% IRR. But in financial contexts, sometimes it's rounded to the nearest tenth, so 30.2%, but maybe the problem expects 30%.\n\nBut looking at similar problems, often they round to the nearest whole number. So 30% IRR.\n\nSo the final answer should be MOIC: 3.75x, IRR: 30%.\n\nWait, but let me check if the debt paid down affects anything else. For example, if they paid down debt, does that mean they had to use cash from operations or something? But the problem states that 400M of debt was paid down, and no remaining surplus cash. So the exit proceeds are the EV, which is 1,500M, and since all debt is paid off, the equity holders get the full 1,500M. So yes, the calculation holds.\n\nAnother possible mistake: confusing the debt financing. The problem says \"financing 50% with debt,\" so the total purchase price is 800M, debt is 400M, equity is 400M. Correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Initial equity investment: $400M\n- Exit equity proceeds: $1,500M\n- MOIC: 1,500 / 400 = 3.75x\n- IRR: (1,500 / 400)^(1/5) - 1 ≈ 30.2% ≈ 30%\n\nTherefore, the answers are MOIC of 3.75x and IRR of 30%.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:MOIC: 3.75x, IRR: 30%",

I remember that enterprise value (EV) is calculated as the market value of equity plus debt minus cash. Wait, no, actually, the formula is EV = Equity Value + Debt - Cash. So to find equity value, I need to rearrange that.\n\nThe problem states the enterprise value is 200 million. There's 60 million in senior debt, 30 million in junior debt, and 10 million in cash. So total debt would be senior plus junior, which is 60 + 30 = 90 million. Then, equity value should be EV minus debt plus cash? Wait, let me double-check the formula.\n\nEnterprise Value = Equity Value + Total Debt - Cash. So rearranged, Equity Value = EV - Total Debt + Cash. Wait, no. Let me think again. If EV = Equity + Debt - Cash, then Equity = EV - Debt + Cash. Wait, no. Let's plug in numbers. Suppose equity is 100, debt is 50, cash is 10. Then EV would be 100 + 50 - 10 = 140. So to get equity, it's EV - Debt + Cash. So yes, Equity = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nSo in this case, EV is 200 million. Total debt is 60 + 30 = 90 million. Cash is 10 million. So Equity Value = 200 - 90 + 10. Let's calculate that: 200 - 90 is 110, plus 10 is 120. So equity value should be 120 million.\n\nWait, but I should make sure about the debt types. Senior and junior debt are both part of total debt, right? So yes, adding them together is correct. Cash is subtracted in EV, so when solving for equity, we add it back. So the calculation seems right. 200 - 90 + 10 = 120.

I need to recall what EPS is and what information I have.\n\nFirst, EPS is calculated as Net Income divided by the number of shares outstanding. The problem gives me 50 shares outstanding, so I need to find the Net Income.\n\nLooking at the given data: Enterprise Value (EV) is 2500, Cash is 200, Debt is 600, and P/E ratio is 15x. Hmm, the P/E ratio is Price to Earnings, so Price per Share divided by EPS. But I don't have the share price directly. Wait, maybe I can find the market capitalization first.\n\nEnterprise Value is calculated as Market Cap + Debt - Cash. So EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash. Let me rearrange that to find Market Cap. Market Cap = EV - Debt + Cash. Plugging in the numbers: 2500 - 600 + 200. Let me calculate that: 2500 - 600 is 1900, plus 200 is 2100. So Market Cap is 2100.\n\nMarket Cap is also equal to Share Price multiplied by Shares Outstanding. So Share Price = Market Cap / Shares Outstanding. That would be 2100 / 50 = 42. So the share price is $42 per share.\n\nNow, the P/E ratio is given as 15x. P/E = Share Price / EPS. So 15 = 42 / EPS. To find EPS, rearrange: EPS = Share Price / P/E = 42 / 15. Let me compute that: 42 divided by 15 is 2.8. So EPS should be $2.80.\n\nWait, let me double-check. EV = 2500, Debt 600, Cash 200. So Market Cap = EV - Debt + Cash = 2500 - 600 + 200 = 2100. Correct.

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the firm is worth 2.5 million, and the question is about how an increase in borrowing rate affects its enterprise value. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what enterprise value (EV) actually is. From what I remember, enterprise value is calculated as the market capitalization plus debt minus cash. But wait, sometimes it's also considered as the value of the firm's operations, including both equity and debt. But the key point here is whether the borrowing rate affects EV.\n\nWait, the borrowing rate is the interest rate the firm pays on its debt. If the borrowing rate increases, that would mean the cost of debt goes up. But how does that impact the firm's value?\n\nWait, enterprise value is supposed to be the total value of the firm, including both debt and equity. But if the borrowing rate increases, does that directly change the firm's value? Or is it more about the cost of capital?\n\nHold on, enterprise value is typically a market-based measure. It's the value that investors would pay to acquire the entire firm, including debt. But if the borrowing rate increases, that might affect the firm's future cash flows, right? Because higher interest expenses would reduce net income, which could lower the equity value. But enterprise value is supposed to be before considering the capital structure, so maybe it's not affected by the cost of debt.\n\nWait, no. Enterprise value is calculated as equity value plus debt minus cash. But if the borrowing rate increases, the market value of the debt might change. Wait, but the question says \"borrowing rate increases\"—does that mean the firm's cost of debt increases, or the market interest rates have gone up?\n\nAssuming the firm's borrowing rate (i.e., the interest rate it pays on its debt) increases, that would mean that for existing debt, the interest expense would go up. But enterprise value is a snapshot of the firm's value at a point in time. If the borrowing rate increases, but the firm's debt is fixed, then the market value of the debt might not change immediately. Wait, but if the market interest rates rise, the value of existing debt would decrease because new debt would be issued at higher rates. But the firm's debt is fixed, so if the market rate goes up, the market value of the firm's debt would decrease. Wait, but enterprise value is calculated using market values. So if the market value of debt decreases, then enterprise value would be equity value plus debt (market value) minus cash. Wait, but if the debt's market value decreases, then the enterprise value would decrease? Hmm, maybe.\n\nWait, but the question is about the firm's enterprise value. Let me think again. Enterprise value is typically calculated as:\n\nEV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash\n\nBut if the borrowing rate increases, meaning the interest rate the firm pays on its debt goes up, but the firm's debt is fixed. However, if the market interest rates rise, the market value of the firm's existing debt would fall because the fixed interest payments are now less attractive compared to new debt at higher rates. So the market value of the debt would decrease. Therefore, if debt's market value decreases, then EV = Market Cap + Debt (lower) - Cash. But wait, the market cap might also be affected. If the cost of debt increases, the firm's overall cost of capital might go up, leading to a lower equity value. So both debt and equity values might adjust.\n\nBut enterprise value is supposed to be the total value of the firm's operations, independent of capital structure. Wait, but in reality, the market value of the firm's equity and debt would adjust based on the new interest rates. However, the question states that the firm is worth 2.5 million. Wait, \"worth\" here might refer to enterprise value. But the question is asking how the enterprise value changes when borrowing rate increases.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's recall that enterprise value is not affected by the capital structure. Wait, no, that's not right. Enterprise value is the total value of the firm, so it should be affected by changes in the cost of capital. But if the borrowing rate increases, the cost of debt increases, which would increase the firm's weighted average cost of capital (WACC), leading to a lower present value of future cash flows, thus lowering the firm's value. But enterprise value is the total value, so if the firm's value decreases, then EV would decrease.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the firm is worth 2.5 million.\" If \"worth\" here refers to enterprise value, then if the borrowing rate increases, causing the firm's value to decrease, then EV would decrease. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick. Enterprise value is calculated as equity value plus debt minus cash. If the borrowing rate increases, the interest expense increases, which reduces net income, so equity value might decrease. But debt's market value might also change. However, if the firm's debt is fixed, and the market interest rate rises, the market value of the debt would fall. So debt (market value) decreases, equity value decreases, so EV = (lower equity) + (lower debt) - cash. Wait, but cash is a separate item. Hmm.\n\nWait, but enterprise value is supposed to be the value of the firm's operations, so it's the sum of the market value of equity and debt, minus cash. If the market value of debt decreases because interest rates have risen, and the market value of equity also decreases because the firm's cost of capital is higher, then EV would decrease.\n\nBut another angle: enterprise value is not affected by the capital structure. Wait, no, that's the Modigliani-Miller theorem, which says that in a perfect market, the value of the firm is unaffected by its capital structure. But that's under the assumption that there are no taxes, bankruptcy costs, etc. However, in reality, higher debt costs can affect the firm's value. But the question is probably expecting a basic answer.\n\nWait, but the question is about borrowing rate increasing. If the borrowing rate (cost of debt) increases, then the firm's cost of capital increases, leading to a lower valuation. So the enterprise value should decrease.\n\nWait, but enterprise value is the total value of the firm, so if the firm's value decreases due to higher cost of capital, then EV decreases. So the answer would be decrease.\n\nBut let me check some sources. For example, if a firm's cost of debt increases, the WACC increases, so the present value of future cash flows decreases, leading to a lower enterprise value. Yes, that makes sense. So the enterprise value would decrease.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be decrease.\n</think>\n\nEnterprise value (EV) is calculated as the market value of equity plus debt minus cash. An increase in the borrowing rate raises the firm's cost of debt, which increases the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). A higher WACC reduces the present value of future cash flows, leading to a lower valuation of the firm. Thus, the enterprise value decreases.\n\n<answer>:decrease",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about finding the EBITDA margin when a business trades at 3x revenue and 6x EBITDA. Hmm, I need to recall what these multiples mean.\n\nFirst, the revenue multiple is 3x. That means the company's market value (or enterprise value) is 3 times its annual revenue. So, Enterprise Value (EV) = 3 × Revenue.\n\nThen, the EBITDA multiple is 6x. So, EV = 6 × EBITDA.\n\nSince both equal EV, I can set them equal to each other. So, 3 × Revenue = 6 × EBITDA. Let me write that down:\n\n3 * Revenue = 6 * EBITDA\n\nIf I solve for EBITDA, divide both sides by 6: EBITDA = (3/6) * Revenue = 0.5 * Revenue.\n\nEBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by Revenue, right? So, (EBITDA / Revenue) * 100 to get the percentage.\n\nFrom above, EBITDA is 0.5 times Revenue, so EBITDA / Revenue = 0.5. Multiply by 100 to get 50%.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. If EV is 3x revenue, and 6x EBITDA, then 3R = 6EBITDA → EBITDA = 0.5R. So margin is 50%. Yeah, that's correct. Sometimes these multiples can be tricky, but the math checks out. So the EBITDA margin would be 50%.\n</think>\n\nTo find the EBITDA margin, equate the enterprise value (EV) derived from both multiples:  \nEV = 3 × Revenue = 6 × EBITDA  \nSolving for EBITDA:  \nEBITDA = (3/6) × Revenue = 0.5 × Revenue  \nEBITDA margin = (EBITDA / Revenue) × 100 = (0.5 × Revenue / Revenue) × 100 = 50%.\n\n<answer>:50%",

      "question": "Suppose Firm X has a share price of $60, a P/E of 12x, and 500 shares outstanding, while Firm Y trades at $30 per share, a P/E of 8x, and has 200 shares outstanding. If Firm X purchases Firm Y entirely with stock, will the deal increase or decrease Firm X's EPS?",
      "ground_truth": "Increase",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is whether Firm X's EPS will increase or decrease after acquiring Firm Y entirely with stock. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what EPS is. EPS stands for Earnings Per Share, which is calculated as net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. So, to compare before and after the acquisition, I need to figure out the EPS for Firm X both before the deal and after the deal.\n\nLet me start by gathering the given information. \n\nFor Firm X:\n- Share price: $60\n- P/E ratio: 12x\n- Shares outstanding: 500\n\nFor Firm Y:\n- Share price: $30\n- P/E ratio: 8x\n- Shares outstanding: 200\n\nHmm, the P/E ratio is Price to Earnings, so P/E = Price / EPS. That means I can find the EPS for each firm by rearranging that formula. EPS = Price / P/E.\n\nSo for Firm X, EPS = $60 / 12 = $5 per share. \n\nFor Firm Y, EPS = $30 / 8 = $3.75 per share.\n\nNow, to find the net income for each firm, since EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding, so Net Income = EPS * Shares Outstanding.\n\nFor Firm X: Net Income = $5 * 500 = $2,500.\n\nFor Firm Y: Net Income = $3.75 * 200 = $750.\n\nNow, the acquisition is done with stock. So Firm X will issue new shares to buy Firm Y. The number of new shares issued would depend on the exchange ratio. But since it's a stock purchase, the number of shares Firm X issues should be based on the price of Firm Y's shares. Wait, but how exactly is the stock exchange ratio determined?\n\nWait, the problem says \"purchases Firm Y entirely with stock.\" Typically, in such acquisitions, the number of shares issued by the acquiring company (Firm X) to acquire the target (Firm Y) is based on the market price of the target's shares. But since Firm Y's shares are trading at $30, and Firm X's shares are at $60, the exchange ratio might be such that Firm X issues shares worth the market value of Firm Y.\n\nWait, but Firm Y has a market capitalization of $30 * 200 = $6,000. So Firm X needs to issue shares worth $6,000. Since Firm X's share price is $60, the number of new shares issued would be $6,000 / $60 = 100 shares.\n\nWait, let me check that. Market cap of Y is 30 * 200 = 6,000. So Firm X pays $6,000 in stock. Since X's stock is $60, they need to issue 6,000 / 60 = 100 shares. So new shares issued: 100.\n\nTherefore, after the acquisition, Firm X's total shares outstanding will be 500 + 100 = 600.\n\nNow, the combined net income would be Firm X's net income plus Firm Y's net income. So $2,500 + $750 = $3,250.\n\nThen, the new EPS for Firm X would be combined net income divided by new shares outstanding: $3,250 / 600 ≈ $5.4167.\n\nOriginal EPS for Firm X was $5. So $5.4167 is higher than $5. Therefore, EPS increases.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is the exchange ratio correctly calculated? Sometimes, in acquisitions, the exchange ratio is based on the P/E ratios or other factors, but the problem states it's a stock purchase, so the standard way is to use the market price. Since Firm Y's shares are $30, and Firm X's shares are $60, the ratio would be 0.5 shares of X for each share of Y. So for 200 shares of Y, Firm X would issue 100 shares (200 * 0.5). That matches the earlier calculation. So 100 new shares.\n\nSo total shares after acquisition: 500 + 100 = 600.\n\nCombined earnings: 2500 + 750 = 3250.\n\nEPS after: 3250 / 600 ≈ 5.4167.\n\nOriginal EPS: 5. So yes, it increases.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: if the acquiring company has a higher P/E ratio than the target, then the acquisition would be accretive. Wait, Firm X has a P/E of 12, Firm Y has 8. So Firm X is trading at a higher P/E, meaning it's more expensive relative to earnings. So when you acquire a company with a lower P/E (Y), you're getting earnings at a lower multiple, which should increase the combined EPS. That's a general rule. So yes, since X's P/E is higher than Y's, the acquisition should be accretive.\n\nLet me confirm with the numbers. The EPS of X is 5, Y is 3.75. So Y's earnings per share are lower than X's. But when you acquire Y, you're adding lower EPS earnings, but since you're paying with X's stock (which is more expensive), the dilution might be less. Wait, but in this case, the calculation shows that the combined EPS is higher. Let's see:\n\nOriginal EPS: 5.\n\nAfter acquisition, EPS = (2500 + 750) / (500 + 100) = 3250 / 600 ≈ 5.4167.\n\nYes, so it's higher. So the deal increases EPS.\n\nWait, but let's make sure about the share count. Firm Y has 200 shares. If Firm X is paying $30 per share for Y, and X's stock is $60, then each share of Y is worth 0.5 shares of X. So 200 shares of Y would require 100 shares of X. So yes, 100 new shares. So total shares 600.\n\nAnother way: the market cap of Y is 30*200=6000. X's share price is 60, so number of shares to issue is 6000/60=100. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems right. Therefore, EPS increases.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Firm X's EPS increases or decreases after acquiring Firm Y with stock, calculate pre- and post-acquisition EPS.\n\n**Pre-acquisition:**\n- Firm X EPS = Share price / P/E = $60 / 12 = $5.00\n- Firm Y EPS = $30 / 8 = $3.75\n\n**Acquisition details:**\n- Firm Y market cap = $30 × 200 = $6,000\n- Shares issued by Firm X = $6,000 / $60 = 100\n- Post-acquisition shares = 500 + 100 = 600\n- Combined net income = ($5 × 500) + ($3.75 × 200) = $2,500 + $750 = $3,250\n\n**Post-acquisition EPS:**\n- EPS = $3,250 / 600 ≈ $5.42\n\nSince $5.42 > $5.00, EPS increases.\n\n<answer>:increase",

      "question": "You operate a phone case business, charging $30 per case, with $14 of manufacturing costs per case, and SG&A at 12% of sales. If you sell 25 cases, what is your EBITDA?",
      "ground_truth": "$310",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating EBITDA for a phone case business. Let me recall what EBITDA stands for—it's Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. But in this case, since we're dealing with a small business, maybe depreciation isn't a factor here. The problem mentions manufacturing costs and SG&A, so I need to focus on those.\n\nFirst, the business sells each case for $30. The manufacturing cost per case is $14. SG&A is 12% of sales. They sell 25 cases. I need to find EBITDA.\n\nLet me break it down. Total sales would be the number of cases sold multiplied by the price per case. So 25 cases * $30 = $750. That's total revenue.\n\nNext, the manufacturing costs. Each case costs $14 to make, so for 25 cases, that's 25 * $14. Let me calculate that: 25 * 14 = $350. So total manufacturing cost is $350.\n\nThen, SG&A is 12% of sales. Sales are $750, so 12% of 750 is 0.12 * 750 = $90. So SG&A expenses are $90.\n\nNow, EBITDA is calculated as Gross Profit minus Operating Expenses (which includes SG&A). Wait, actually, EBITDA is typically calculated as Revenue minus COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) minus Operating Expenses (like SG&A), but sometimes it's presented as EBIT plus Depreciation and Amortization. But since the problem doesn't mention depreciation, maybe we can ignore that.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Gross Profit is Revenue minus COGS. COGS here would be the manufacturing costs. So Gross Profit = $750 - $350 = $400.\n\nThen, Operating Expenses would be SG&A, which is $90. So Operating Income (EBIT) would be Gross Profit minus Operating Expenses: $400 - $90 = $310.\n\nSince EBITDA is EBIT plus Depreciation and Amortization, and if there's no depreciation mentioned, then EBITDA would be the same as EBIT. So $310.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says SG&A is 12% of sales. So SG&A is $90, which is an operating expense. So yes, subtracting that from Gross Profit gives Operating Income, which is EBIT. Since there's no mention of depreciation or amortization, EBITDA equals EBIT here. So the answer should be $310.\n\nLet me verify the calculations again to be sure.\n\nSales: 25 * 30 = 750. Correct.\n\nCOGS: 25 * 14 = 350. Correct.\n\nGross Profit: 750 - 350 = 400. Correct.\n\nSG&A: 12% of 750 = 90. Correct.\n\nEBIT: 400 - 90 = 310. So EBITDA is 310.\n\nYes, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. The key points are calculating total sales, subtracting COGS (manufacturing costs), then subtracting SG&A (which is a percentage of sales). Since EBITDA doesn't include interest, taxes, depreciation, or amortization, and none of those are mentioned, the calculation stops at EBIT, which equals EBITDA in this case.\n</think>\n\nTotal sales = 25 cases × $30 = $750  \nCOGS = 25 cases × $14 = $350  \nGross profit = $750 - $350 = $400  \nSG&A = 12% × $750 = $90  \nEBITDA = Gross profit - SG&A = $400 - $90 = $310  \n\n<answer>:310",

      "question": "A firm records 120 million in total revenue and 90 million in operating costs, yielding 30 million in operating profit. Of these costs, 50 percent are fixed and 50 percent are variable. If volume rises by 15 percent, by how much does operating profit change?",
      "ground_truth": "$11.5 million increase",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the firm has total revenue of $120 million and operating costs of $90 million, leading to an operating profit of $30 million. The costs are split 50% fixed and 50% variable. The question is, if volume increases by 15%, how much does the operating profit change?\n\nFirst, I need to recall that fixed costs don't change with volume, while variable costs do. Since 50% of the operating costs are fixed and 50% variable, let's break that down. Operating costs are $90 million, so fixed costs are 50% of 90 million, which is $45 million. Variable costs are also $45 million.\n\nNow, volume rises by 15%. Volume here probably refers to the quantity of goods or services sold. If volume increases, variable costs should increase proportionally because they depend on the volume. Fixed costs remain the same.\n\nSo, the original variable cost is $45 million. A 15% increase in volume would mean variable costs increase by 15%. Let me calculate that: 15% of 45 million is 0.15 * 45 = $6.75 million. So new variable costs would be 45 + 6.75 = $51.75 million.\n\nFixed costs stay at $45 million. So total new operating costs would be fixed + new variable = 45 + 51.75 = $96.75 million.\n\nWait, but what about revenue? The problem says total revenue is $120 million. If volume increases by 15%, does revenue also increase by 15%? The problem states \"volume rises by 15 percent,\" and typically, revenue would scale with volume if the price per unit remains constant. So revenue should increase by 15% as well.\n\nOriginal revenue: $120 million. 15% increase: 120 * 0.15 = $18 million. So new revenue is 120 + 18 = $138 million.\n\nOperating profit is revenue minus operating costs. Original operating profit was 120 - 90 = 30 million. New operating profit would be 138 - 96.75 = $41.25 million.\n\nSo the change in operating profit is 41.25 - 30 = $11.25 million.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's verify the variable cost part. If variable costs are 50% of operating costs, which is $45 million, then the variable cost per unit would be based on the original volume. But since volume increases by 15%, variable costs should increase by 15%, so yes, 45 * 1.15 = 51.75 million. Fixed costs remain 45 million. Total costs now 96.75 million.\n\nRevenue: assuming it's proportional to volume, so 120 * 1.15 = 138 million. Profit is 138 - 96.75 = 41.25 million. Original profit was 30 million, so the change is 11.25 million.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the 15% volume increase affects both revenue and variable costs, but fixed costs stay the same. So the change in profit would be the increase in revenue minus the increase in variable costs.\n\nOriginal revenue: 120, variable costs: 45. So the contribution margin (revenue minus variable costs) is 120 - 45 = 75 million. Fixed costs are 45 million, so profit is 75 - 45 = 30 million.\n\nWhen volume increases by 15%, the contribution margin should increase by 15% because variable costs are proportional. So new contribution margin is 75 * 1.15 = 86.25 million. Then new profit is 86.25 - 45 (fixed costs) = 41.25 million. So the change is 41.25 - 30 = 11.25 million. Same result.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the operating profit increases by $11.25 million.\n\nWait, but the question says \"by how much does operating profit change?\" So it's a $11.25 million increase. The answer should be 11.25 million, but let's check if it's in millions. The original numbers are in millions, so the answer should be 11.25 million, which is $11.25 million.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Original variable costs: 45 million. 15% increase in volume leads to 15% increase in variable costs: 45 * 0.15 = 6.75 million. So variable costs up by 6.75. Revenue up by 15%: 120 * 0.15 = 18 million. So the change in profit is 18 (revenue increase) - 6.75 (variable cost increase) = 11.25 million. Fixed costs don't change, so that's the total change. Yes, that's a quicker way: the change in profit is (revenue increase) minus (variable cost increase), since fixed costs are unchanged.\n\nSo revenue increase: 120 * 15% = 18 million.\n\nVariable cost increase: 45 * 15% = 6.75 million.\n\nProfit change: 18 - 6.75 = 11.25 million.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the operating profit increases by $11.25 million.\n</think>\n\nThe firm's operating profit change is calculated by considering the impact of a 15% volume increase on revenue and variable costs. Original revenue is $120 million, so a 15% increase yields $18 million in additional revenue. Variable costs are 50% of $90 million, or $45 million, so a 15% increase in variable costs is $6.75 million. The change in operating profit is the difference between the revenue increase and variable cost increase: $18 million - $6.75 million = $11.25 million.\n\n<answer>:11.25 million",

      "question": "Suppose a company begins with revenue of 70 and EBITDA of 14. Over five years, it consistently maintains the same EBITDA margin while revenue rises by 10 each year. The business is bought at a 350 enterprise value, 60% funded through debt, and sold at a 450 enterprise value. Every year, depreciation and amortization is 3, capital expenditure is 3, the tax rate is 50 percent, there is no interest expense, and net working capital does not change. What are the MOIC and IRR?",
      "ground_truth": "2x MOIC, 15% IRR",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return) for a company's investment. Let me break down all the given information and see what I need to do.\n\nFirst, the company starts with revenue of 70 and EBITDA of 14. Over five years, revenue increases by 10 each year. So, year 1 revenue is 70, year 2 is 80, year 3 is 90, year 4 is 100, year 5 is 110. Wait, but EBITDA margin is consistent. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue. Initially, EBITDA is 14 on revenue 70, so margin is 14/70 = 20%. So each year, EBITDA should be 20% of the revenue. Let me confirm that. So for year 1: 70 * 0.2 = 14, which matches. Year 2: 80 * 0.2 = 16, year 3: 90*0.2=18, year 4: 100*0.2=20, year 5: 110*0.2=22. So EBITDA each year is increasing as revenue increases.\n\nNow, the business is bought at 350 enterprise value (EV), 60% funded through debt. Wait, but the problem says \"bought at a 350 enterprise value, 60% funded through debt\". So the equity investment would be 40% of 350, right? Because 60% debt, so 40% equity. So initial equity investment is 0.4 * 350 = 140. But wait, the problem says \"60% funded through debt\", so the total purchase price is 350, with 60% debt (so 0.6*350=210 debt) and 40% equity (140). So the investor's equity is 140.\n\nThen, sold at 450 EV. So the exit EV is 450. The equity received at exit would be 450 minus the debt paid off. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention any debt repayment during the holding period. Wait, the problem states \"60% funded through debt\", so the debt is 210, and assuming that the debt is paid off at exit, so the equity received would be 450 - 210 = 240. Wait, but the problem says \"sold at a 450 enterprise value\". Enterprise value is typically EV = equity value + debt - cash. But if the company is sold at EV 450, then the buyer pays 450, which would be the equity value plus debt. Wait, no: EV is the total value of the company, so if the company is sold for EV 450, then the equity value would be EV minus debt (assuming no cash). But the problem says \"sold at a 450 enterprise value\", so the EV is 450. So the equity value at exit would be EV minus debt. But the debt was 210, so if the debt is still outstanding, then the equity received would be 450 - 210 = 240. But the problem doesn't specify if the debt is repaid or not. However, typically, when a company is sold, the debt is paid off by the buyer, so the seller (the investor) would receive the equity value, which is EV minus debt. So exit equity value is 450 - 210 = 240.\n\nWait, but let's confirm. The initial investment: bought at EV 350, 60% debt, so debt is 210, equity is 140. At exit, EV is 450. Assuming the debt is still 210 (no change in debt), then the equity value at exit is 450 - 210 = 240. So the investor's equity goes from 140 to 240. So the MOIC is 240 / 140 = 1.714..., which is approximately 1.71x.\n\nBut wait, MOIC is usually calculated as the total return divided by the initial investment. So if they invested 140 and got back 240, then MOIC is 240 / 140 = 1.714, so 1.71x.\n\nNow, for IRR. IRR is the annualized rate of return. The investment period is 5 years. So the cash flows would be: initial outflow of 140 at time 0, and inflow of 240 at time 5. So the IRR is the rate that satisfies 140 = 240 / (1 + IRR)^5. So (1 + IRR)^5 = 240 / 140 = 1.7142857. Then, IRR = (1.7142857)^(1/5) - 1.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1.7142857^(0.2). Let's see. 1.7142857 is approximately 12/7. Let's compute 1.7142857^(1/5). Let's use logarithms. ln(1.7142857) ≈ 0.5389965. Divide by 5: 0.1077993. Exponentiate: e^0.1077993 ≈ 1.1138. So IRR ≈ 11.38%.\n\nBut let me check with a calculator. Let's compute 1.11^5: 1.11^2=1.2321, 1.11^3=1.3676, 1.11^4=1.5181, 1.11^5=1.6851. That's less than 1.714. 1.12^5: 1.12^2=1.2544, 1.12^3=1.4049, 1.12^4=1.5735, 1.12^5=1.7623. So 1.12^5 is about 1.7623, which is higher than 1.714. So the IRR is between 11% and 12%. Let's do linear approximation. At 11%, 1.6851; at 12%, 1.7623. The target is 1.7143. The difference between 1.7143 and 1.6851 is 0.0292. The total interval is 1.7623 - 1.6851 = 0.0772. So 0.0292 / 0.0772 ≈ 0.378. So approximately 11% + 0.378*(1%) ≈ 11.38%, which matches the earlier calculation. So IRR is approximately 11.4%.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions other details: depreciation and amortization is 3 each year, capital expenditure is 3, tax rate 50%, no interest expense, net working capital doesn't change. Wait, but if we're calculating cash flows for IRR, do we need to consider these?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the business is bought at a 350 enterprise value... sold at a 450 enterprise value\". Enterprise value is typically calculated as equity value plus debt minus cash. But in this case, the problem states EV at purchase and sale, so maybe the cash flows from operations are not needed because the EV is given. Wait, but the problem might be tricking us into thinking that the EV changes due to operations, but actually, the EV at purchase is 350, and at sale is 450, so the change in EV is due to the company's performance. However, the problem states that the company's revenue and EBITDA are changing, but the EV is given as 350 at purchase and 450 at sale. So perhaps the EV is not calculated based on EBITDA but given directly. So maybe the other details (depreciation, capex, tax, etc.) are red herrings, or perhaps they are needed to calculate the cash flows for the IRR.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the business is bought at a 350 enterprise value... sold at a 450 enterprise value\". So the EV at exit is 450, which is the total value. So the equity value at exit would be EV minus debt. But the debt is 60% of the purchase price, so 0.6*350=210. Assuming that the debt remains the same (no additional debt or repayment), then at exit, the debt is still 210, so equity value is 450 - 210 = 240. So the investor's equity investment is 140 (40% of 350), and gets back 240, so MOIC is 240/140 ≈ 1.71x.\n\nBut why are the other details given? Let's check. The problem mentions depreciation and amortization (D&A) is 3 each year, capex is 3, tax rate 50%, no interest expense, no change in net working capital. Wait, but if we're to calculate the cash flows from operations, maybe the EV change is not directly given but needs to be calculated. Wait, no, the problem states \"bought at a 350 enterprise value, 60% funded through debt, and sold at a 450 enterprise value\". So the EV at purchase and sale are given, so the change in EV is from 350 to 450, which is a $100 increase. But the question is about the investor's return, which depends on the equity investment and the equity received.\n\nWait, but maybe the EV is calculated based on the company's performance, but the problem states the EV at purchase and sale directly, so perhaps the other details are irrelevant. Let's see. For example, EBITDA is given, but EV is given, so maybe the EV is not calculated from EBITDA. So perhaps the other details (D&A, capex, tax) are distractions.\n\nBut let's confirm. The problem says \"the business is bought at a 350 enterprise value\", so the purchase price is 350 EV. Then, over five years, the company's revenue and EBITDA change, but the EV at sale is 450. So the EV increased from 350 to 450, which is a $100 increase. But the investor's equity is 40% of 350, so 140, and at exit, the equity is 450 - debt. The debt is 60% of 350, which is 210. Assuming the debt is still 210 at exit (since it's not mentioned that debt was repaid or changed), then equity at exit is 450 - 210 = 240. So the return is 240 / 140 = 1.714, so MOIC is 1.71x.\n\nFor IRR, it's the annualized return over 5 years. So the cash flows are: -140 at time 0, +240 at time 5. So IRR is (240/140)^(1/5) - 1 = (1.7142857)^0.2 - 1 ≈ 11.38%, which rounds to 11.4%.\n\nBut let's check if the other details are relevant. For example, if the EV is not given but needs to be calculated from EBITDA, but the problem states the EV at purchase and sale, so probably not. Let's see: EBITDA margin is consistent. The company's EBITDA each year is 20% of revenue. Revenue starts at 70, increases by 10 each year. So EBITDA is 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 over five years. But EV is given as 350 at purchase and 450 at sale, so maybe the EV is not based on EBITDA but given. So the other details (D&A, capex, tax) might be irrelevant for the MOIC and IRR calculation here, because the EV is provided.\n\nWait, but another angle: sometimes, in private equity, the return is calculated based on the equity value, which might require calculating the cash flows from operations. But the problem states the EV at purchase and sale, so perhaps the EV is the total value, and the equity value is EV minus debt. So the initial equity investment is 40% of 350 (since 60% debt), and exit equity is 450 minus debt (210), so 240. So the calculation as before.\n\nLet me check if the problem mentions anything about the debt being repaid. It says \"60% funded through debt\", which typically means that the debt is part of the purchase price, so the debt is 210, and the investor puts in 140 equity. At exit, the company is sold for EV 450, so the buyer pays 450, which would cover the debt (210) and leave 240 for equity. So the investor gets back 240. So yes, MOIC is 240/140 = 1.71x.\n\nFor IRR, as calculated, approximately 11.4%.\n\nWait, but let's make sure about the time period. The company is held for five years, so the investment is for five years. So the cash flows are at year 0 and year 5.\n\nAnother check: the problem says \"over five years, it consistently maintains the same EBITDA margin while revenue rises by 10 each year\". So the EBITDA margin is 20%, as calculated. But since EV is given, maybe the EBITDA is irrelevant here. So the other details (D&A, capex, tax) are probably distractors.\n\nFor example, if we were to calculate the free cash flow (FCF), it would be EBITDA - D&A - Capex - Taxes. Let's see:\n\nEBITDA each year: 14, 16, 18, 20, 22.\n\nD&A is 3 each year, so EBIT - D&A = EBITDA - D&A = EBITDA - 3.\n\nBut EBITDA is already after D&A? Wait, EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. So EBITDA = EBIT + D&A. So EBIT = EBITDA - D&A.\n\nThen, taxes = EBIT * tax rate = (EBITDA - D&A) * 50%.\n\nThen, FCF = EBITDA - D&A - Capex - Taxes.\n\nWait, let's compute FCF for each year.\n\nYear 1:\n\nEBITDA = 14\n\nD&A = 3\n\nEBIT = 14 - 3 = 11\n\nTaxes = 11 * 0.5 = 5.5\n\nCapex = 3\n\nFCF = EBITDA - D&A - Capex - Taxes = 14 - 3 - 3 - 5.5 = 2.5\n\nWait, but another way: FCF = EBITDA - D&A - Capex - Taxes = 14 - 3 - 3 - 5.5 = 2.5.\n\nSimilarly, Year 2:\n\nEBITDA = 16\n\nEBIT = 16 - 3 = 13\n\nTaxes = 13 * 0.5 = 6.5\n\nFCF = 16 - 3 - 3 - 6.5 = 3.5\n\nYear 3: EBITDA 18, EBIT 15, taxes 7.5, FCF = 18-3-3-7.5=4.5\n\nYear 4: EBITDA 20, EBIT 17, taxes 8.5, FCF=20-3-3-8.5=5.5\n\nYear 5: EBITDA 22, EBIT 19, taxes 9.5, FCF=22-3-3-9.5=6.5\n\nSo the FCF each year is 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5.\n\nBut how does this relate to the EV? The EV at purchase is 350, and at sale is 450. The change in EV is 100 over 5 years. But the FCF is the cash flow generated, which would affect the EV. However, the problem states the EV at purchase and sale directly, so perhaps the FCF is irrelevant here. The problem might be testing if we get distracted by the FCF details.\n\nBut let's see: if we were to calculate the EV at exit based on FCF, but the problem says it's sold at 450 EV, so we don't need to calculate it. So the FCF details are probably red herrings.\n\nTherefore, the MOIC is 240 / 140 = 1.714..., which is 1.71x.\n\nIRR is the rate that makes the present value of 240 at year 5 equal to 140. So 140 = 240 / (1 + IRR)^5 → (1 + IRR)^5 = 240/140 ≈ 1.7143 → IRR ≈ 11.4%.\n\nSo the final answers should be MOIC: 1.71x, IRR: 11.4%.\n\nWait, but let's confirm the MOIC format. MOIC is usually expressed as a multiple, like 1.71x, so 1.71x.\n\nIRR is typically rounded to one decimal place, so 11.4%.\n\nNow, check if the problem mentions anything about the debt being repaid during the holding period. It says \"60% funded through debt\", which is at the time of purchase. If the debt is paid off during the five years, but the problem doesn't state that. It says \"no interest expense\", which might imply that the debt is interest-free, but still, the principal would need to be repaid. However, since the problem states \"sold at a 450 enterprise value\", and enterprise value typically assumes that debt is paid off by the buyer, so the seller (the investor) receives the equity value, which is EV minus debt. If the debt was paid off during the holding period, the debt would be zero at exit, but the problem doesn't say that. So the standard assumption is that the debt remains until exit, so the debt at exit is still 210.\n\nTherefore, the equity at exit is 450 - 210 = 240.\n\nInitial equity investment: 350 * 0.4 = 140.\n\nMOIC = 240 / 140 = 1.714... ≈ 1.71x.\n\nIRR: as calculated, approximately 11.4%.\n\nSo the final answer should be MOIC: 1.71x, IRR: 11.4%.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:1.71x, 11.4%",

      "question": "You run a coffee mug shop charging $25 per mug. Your production cost per mug is $12, and you also pay a 15% overhead on the selling price. You plan to double your total revenue by increasing prices not volume. What will your EBITDA be after the price increase?",
      "ground_truth": "$457.50",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user runs a coffee mug shop. The current price per mug is $25. The production cost per mug is $12, and there's a 15% overhead on the selling price. They want to double their total revenue by increasing prices, not volume. We need to find the new EBITDA after the price increase.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what EBITDA is. EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. So, it's basically the operating profit before those deductions. To calculate EBITDA, we need to find the revenue minus the operating expenses, which in this case would be the production costs and the overhead.\n\nWait, the problem mentions a 15% overhead on the selling price. So overhead is calculated as 15% of the selling price, not the cost. Let me confirm that. The problem says \"15% overhead on the selling price,\" so yes, it's 15% of $25 per mug.\n\nLet me break down the current situation first. Current selling price: $25 per mug. Production cost: $12 per mug. Overhead: 15% of $25, which is 0.15 * 25 = $3.75 per mug.\n\nSo, current cost per mug is production cost plus overhead: $12 + $3.75 = $15.75 per mug. Wait, but overhead is a cost, so total cost per unit would be production cost plus overhead. But let me make sure. The problem says \"you also pay a 15% overhead on the selling price.\" So overhead is a cost that's 15% of the selling price, so for each mug sold at $25, the overhead cost is $3.75. So total cost per mug is $12 (production) + $3.75 (overhead) = $15.75.\n\nBut wait, is the overhead a fixed cost or variable? The problem says \"15% overhead on the selling price,\" which suggests it's a variable cost per unit, since it's based on the selling price per mug. So for each mug sold, the overhead is 15% of the selling price. So if they sell more mugs, the overhead increases proportionally. But in this case, they're not changing the volume, just the price. Wait, the problem says they plan to double total revenue by increasing prices, not volume. So they're keeping the same number of units sold but doubling the revenue. Wait, no—if they double revenue by increasing price, not volume, that means they're selling the same number of mugs but at a higher price. Wait, but if they double revenue, and volume stays the same, then the new price must be double the original price. Wait, original revenue is price * quantity. If they double revenue without changing quantity, then new price = 2 * original price. So original price is $25, so new price would be $50. But let's confirm.\n\nOriginal revenue: let's say they sell Q mugs. Revenue = 25 * Q. To double revenue, new revenue = 50 * Q. So yes, new price is $50 per mug.\n\nNow, the new overhead will be 15% of the new selling price. So 15% of $50 is 0.15 * 50 = $7.50 per mug.\n\nProduction cost per mug is still $12 (assuming that doesn't change). So new total cost per mug is $12 + $7.50 = $19.50.\n\nWait, but EBITDA is revenue minus operating expenses. Operating expenses here would be the production cost and the overhead. So for each mug, revenue is $50, cost is $12 (production) + $7.50 (overhead) = $19.50. So profit per mug is $50 - $19.50 = $30.50.\n\nBut wait, EBITDA is total, not per unit. But since we're dealing with the same quantity (since volume isn't changing), the total EBITDA would be (new price - production cost - new overhead) * quantity.\n\nBut since we're doubling revenue, and revenue is price * quantity, doubling revenue with same quantity means new price is double. So original revenue R = 25Q. New revenue is 50Q = 2R.\n\nOriginal cost per unit: production cost $12 + overhead 15% of 25 = $3.75, so total cost per unit $15.75. So original total cost is 15.75Q.\n\nOriginal EBITDA would be R - total cost = 25Q - 15.75Q = 9.25Q.\n\nAfter price increase, new revenue is 50Q. New overhead is 15% of 50 = $7.50 per unit. So new total cost per unit is 12 + 7.50 = 19.50. So new total cost is 19.50Q.\n\nNew EBITDA = 50Q - 19.50Q = 30.50Q.\n\nBut the question is asking for the EBITDA after the price increase. However, we don't have the quantity Q. Wait, but maybe we can express it in terms of the original revenue or something else. Wait, but the problem might be expecting a per-unit calculation, but EBITDA is a total figure. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem assumes that we're to calculate the EBITDA per unit, but that's not standard. EBITDA is a total, but since the quantity isn't given, perhaps they want the per-unit EBITDA. Wait, but the problem says \"what will your EBITDA be,\" so maybe they expect a per-unit figure, or perhaps they assume a certain quantity. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the number of mugs sold. So maybe we need to express it in terms of the original revenue or find a ratio.\n\nWait, but let's think again. The problem states \"double your total revenue by increasing prices not volume.\" So if original revenue is R, new revenue is 2R. Original revenue R = 25 * Q. New revenue 2R = 50 * Q (since Q is same). So the new price is $50.\n\nNow, to find EBITDA, which is revenue minus operating expenses. Operating expenses here are production cost and overhead. Production cost is $12 per unit, so total production cost is 12Q. Overhead is 15% of selling price, so for each unit, it's 0.15 * 50 = $7.50, so total overhead is 7.50Q.\n\nTherefore, total operating expenses = 12Q + 7.50Q = 19.50Q.\n\nEBITDA = new revenue - total operating expenses = 50Q - 19.50Q = 30.50Q.\n\nBut we need a numerical value. However, since Q is unknown, perhaps the problem expects us to express EBITDA in terms of the original revenue or find a per-unit value. Wait, but the problem might have a typo or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the overhead is a fixed cost, not variable. But the problem says \"15% overhead on the selling price,\" which implies it's based on the selling price, so per unit. So it's variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the overhead is a fixed cost, but the problem states \"on the selling price,\" which usually would mean it's a percentage of revenue, so variable. For example, if you have a 15% overhead on sales, it's 15% of revenue. So total overhead would be 0.15 * revenue.\n\nWait, that's a different interpretation. If overhead is 15% of the selling price, but selling price is per unit, so for each unit sold, overhead is 15% of that unit's price. So total overhead would be 0.15 * total revenue. Wait, because total revenue is sum of all selling prices, so 15% of total revenue would be the total overhead.\n\nWait, let's clarify. If the overhead is 15% of the selling price per mug, then for each mug sold at $25, overhead is $3.75, so total overhead for Q mugs is 3.75Q. Alternatively, if it's 15% of total revenue, then total overhead is 0.15 * (25Q) = 3.75Q. So either way, it's the same. So total overhead is 15% of total revenue.\n\nWait, that's a key point. If overhead is 15% of the selling price (per unit), then total overhead is 15% of total revenue. Because total revenue is price per unit * quantity, so 15% of that would be the total overhead.\n\nSo, for example, if total revenue is R, then overhead is 0.15R.\n\nSimilarly, after the price increase, new total revenue is 2R (since they're doubling revenue), so new overhead would be 0.15 * 2R = 0.3R.\n\nProduction cost: the problem says \"production cost per mug is $12,\" so total production cost is 12Q. But since original revenue R = 25Q, then Q = R/25. So total production cost is 12*(R/25) = (12/25)R.\n\nAfter price increase, revenue is 2R, so quantity Q remains the same (since volume isn't changing), so Q = R/25 (original quantity). So new production cost is still 12Q = 12*(R/25) = (12/25)R.\n\nOverhead after price increase: 15% of new revenue = 0.15*2R = 0.3R.\n\nSo total operating expenses = production cost + overhead = (12/25)R + 0.3R.\n\nLet's compute that. 12/25 is 0.48, so 0.48R + 0.3R = 0.78R.\n\nEBITDA = new revenue - total operating expenses = 2R - 0.78R = 1.22R.\n\nBut we need a numerical value. However, the problem doesn't give us the original revenue R. So this approach might not be helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects us to calculate per unit. Let's try that.\n\nOriginal per unit:\n\nSelling price: $25\n\nProduction cost: $12\n\nOverhead: 15% of $25 = $3.75\n\nTotal cost per unit: $12 + $3.75 = $15.75\n\nProfit per unit: $25 - $15.75 = $9.25\n\nAfter price increase:\n\nNew selling price: $50 (to double revenue with same quantity)\n\nOverhead: 15% of $50 = $7.50\n\nTotal cost per unit: $12 + $7.50 = $19.50\n\nProfit per unit: $50 - $19.50 = $30.50\n\nSo EBITDA per unit is $30.50. But EBITDA is usually a total, not per unit. However, since the problem doesn't specify the quantity, maybe they want the per-unit EBITDA. But the question says \"what will your EBITDA be,\" which is a total. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem assumes that the original revenue is based on a certain number of units, but since it's not given, perhaps we're to express it in terms of the original revenue. But the problem likely expects a numerical answer, so maybe I made a mistake in assuming the new price is $50.\n\nWait, let's re-examine. \"Double your total revenue by increasing prices not volume.\" So if they increase price, and keep the same number of units sold, then new revenue = new price * original quantity. Original revenue = 25 * Q. New revenue = 2 * 25 * Q = 50 * Q. So new price must be $50. That seems right.\n\nSo per unit, as above, EBITDA per unit is $30.50. But since EBITDA is total, and we don't have Q, but maybe the problem expects the answer per unit, or perhaps they consider that the question is asking for the EBITDA margin or something else. Wait, but the problem says \"what will your EBITDA be,\" so it's a total. But without knowing Q, we can't give a total. However, maybe the problem expects us to calculate the EBITDA per unit, and that's the answer they want.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the overhead is a fixed cost, but the problem says \"15% overhead on the selling price,\" which is more likely variable. Let's check the problem statement again: \"you also pay a 15% overhead on the selling price.\" So for each mug, the overhead is 15% of the selling price of that mug. So it's variable.\n\nGiven that, and since the quantity remains the same, the EBITDA will be (new price - production cost - new overhead per unit) * quantity.\n\nBut since we don't have quantity, but the problem might expect the answer per unit, or perhaps they made a mistake and want the per-unit EBITDA.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the original revenue is $25 per mug, so for one mug, but that's not standard. Let's see.\n\nIf we assume they sell one mug originally, then:\n\nOriginal revenue: $25\n\nProduction cost: $12\n\nOverhead: 15% of $25 = $3.75\n\nTotal cost: $15.75\n\nEBITDA: $25 - $15.75 = $9.25\n\nAfter doubling revenue, new revenue is $50 (for one mug, since volume not changed).\n\nNew price: $50\n\nOverhead: 15% of $50 = $7.50\n\nTotal cost: $12 + $7.50 = $19.50\n\nEBITDA: $50 - $19.50 = $30.50\n\nSo the EBITDA would be $30.50. Since the problem doesn't specify quantity, but asks for EBITDA, and in the absence of quantity, it's likely they expect the per-unit EBITDA, or perhaps they assume a single unit. But EBITDA is typically a total, but maybe in this context, since it's a per-unit calculation, they want $30.50.\n\nWait, but let's check the calculation again.\n\nNew price: $50\n\nProduction cost: $12 (per mug)\n\nOverhead: 15% of $50 = $7.50\n\nTotal cost per mug: $12 + $7.50 = $19.50\n\nRevenue per mug: $50\n\nEBITDA per mug: $50 - $19.50 = $30.50\n\nYes, so if they sell one mug, EBITDA is $30.50. If they sell Q mugs, it's $30.50 * Q. But since the problem doesn't specify Q, and it's a math problem, they probably expect the per-unit EBITDA, so $30.50.\n\nBut let's confirm if overhead is calculated correctly. The problem says \"15% overhead on the selling price.\" So selling price is $50, so overhead is 0.15*50 = $7.50. Yes.\n\nProduction cost is $12, which is a separate cost. So total cost per unit is $12 + $7.50 = $19.50.\n\nRevenue per unit is $50, so EBITDA per unit is $50 - $19.50 = $30.50.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $30.50.\n\nWait, but EBITDA is usually a total, but since the problem doesn't give quantity, and it's a per-unit calculation, I think that's what they want. So the final answer is $30.50.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the EBITDA after doubling revenue by increasing price (not volume), we start with the original price of $25 per mug. Doubling revenue with the same volume requires the new price to be $50 per mug.\n\n- **New selling price**: $50  \n- **Production cost per mug**: $12 (unchanged)  \n- **Overhead**: 15% of new selling price = 0.15 × $50 = $7.50  \n- **Total cost per mug**: $12 + $7.50 = $19.50  \n- **EBITDA per mug**: $50 - $19.50 = $30.50  \n\nSince the problem does not specify quantity and EBITDA is typically calculated per unit in such contexts, the final EBITDA per mug is $30.50.\n\n<answer>:$30.50",

      "question": "Suppose you run a business selling backpacks at $25 each and sell 20 backpacks. Producing each backpack costs $12, and your SG&A expenses are 12% of revenue. You want to double your total revenue solely by increasing volume, not by raising prices. What is your EBITDA after this increase?",
      "ground_truth": "$400",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user runs a business selling backpacks at $25 each, selling 20 units. The cost to produce each backpack is $12, and SG&A expenses are 12% of revenue. They want to double their total revenue by increasing volume, not price. We need to find the EBITDA after this increase.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what EBITDA is. EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. So, it's basically operating profit plus depreciation and amortization, but in this problem, since there's no mention of depreciation or amortization, EBITDA would just be the operating profit before those items. But since the problem doesn't mention those, I think we can assume EBITDA here is the same as operating income, which is revenue minus COGS and SG&A.\n\nWait, let's confirm. EBITDA is typically calculated as net income + interest + taxes + depreciation + amortization. But in this context, since they're asking for EBITDA and the problem doesn't mention interest, taxes, depreciation, or amortization, it's likely that they just want revenue minus operating expenses (COGS and SG&A). So, EBITDA = Revenue - COGS - SG&A.\n\nOriginal scenario: Selling 20 backpacks at $25 each. So original revenue is 20 * 25 = $500.\n\nCOGS (Cost of Goods Sold) is $12 per backpack, so 20 * 12 = $240.\n\nSG&A is 12% of revenue, so 12% of $500 is 0.12 * 500 = $60.\n\nOriginal EBITDA would be Revenue - COGS - SG&A = 500 - 240 - 60 = $200. But the question isn't about the original, it's about doubling revenue by increasing volume.\n\nThey want to double total revenue solely by increasing volume, not price. So original revenue is $500, doubling it would be $1000. Since price per backpack remains $25, the new quantity sold would be 1000 / 25 = 40 backpacks.\n\nNow, calculate the new COGS: 40 * 12 = $480.\n\nSG&A is 12% of new revenue, so 12% of $1000 = $120.\n\nSo new EBITDA = Revenue - COGS - SG&A = 1000 - 480 - 120 = $400.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Revenue is $1000. COGS is 40 * 12 = 480. SG&A is 12% of 1000, which is 120. So 1000 - 480 is 520, minus 120 is 400. Yes, that's right.\n\nSo the EBITDA after doubling revenue by increasing volume is $400.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem says \"double your total revenue solely by increasing volume, not by raising prices.\" So original revenue is 20*25=500, double is 1000. So new quantity is 1000/25=40. Correct.\n\nCOGS is per unit, so 40*12=480. SG&A is 12% of revenue, so 12% of 1000=120. So EBITDA is 1000 - 480 - 120 = 400. That seems right.\n\nI think that's it. So the final answer should be $400.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the EBITDA after doubling revenue by increasing volume:\n\n1. **Original Revenue**: 20 backpacks × $25 = $500  \n2. **Target Revenue**: Double of $500 = $1000  \n3. **New Quantity**: $1000 ÷ $25 = 40 backpacks  \n4. **New COGS**: 40 × $12 = $480  \n5. **New SG&A**: 12% of $1000 = $120  \n6. **EBITDA**: Revenue - COGS - SG&A = $1000 - $480 - $120 = $400  \n\n<answer>:$400",

      "question": "A firm has two tranches of debt, each at 150M, for a total of 300M, while its enterprise value is 250M. What does each tranche trade at?",
      "ground_truth": "83% of par",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the firm has two tranches of debt, each at 150M, totaling 300M. The enterprise value is 250M. The question is asking what each tranche trades at.\n\nHmm, enterprise value (EV) is usually the market value of equity plus debt minus cash. But here, the EV is given as 250M, which is less than the total debt of 300M. Wait, that seems odd because typically, if a company's EV is less than its debt, it might be in distress. But how does that affect the trading price of the tranches?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The tranches are parts of the debt. If the total debt is 300M (two tranches of 150M each), but the EV is 250M, which is lower than the debt. In distressed debt scenarios, the market value of debt might be less than its face value. But how to calculate the exact trading price?\n\nWait, enterprise value is often used to value a company, but here the EV is 250M, which is less than the total debt. So the equity value would be EV minus debt plus cash, but maybe cash is zero here. If EV is 250M, and total debt is 300M, then the equity would be negative, which might mean the company is insolvent. But the question is about the debt tranches trading at what price.\n\nIn such cases, the market value of debt might be a fraction of the face value. But how to determine the exact amount? Maybe the total market value of debt should equal the EV? Wait, no. The EV is the value of the firm's operations, but if the firm's assets are worth less than the debt, the debt might trade at a discount.\n\nWait, perhaps the total market value of the debt should be equal to the enterprise value? But that doesn't make sense because EV includes equity and debt. Wait, EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash. If the company's EV is 250M, but the debt is 300M, then the equity would be negative, which implies the company is bankrupt. In bankruptcy, the debt might trade at a fraction of face value.\n\nBut the problem states two tranches each at 150M. So each tranche is a separate debt instrument. If the total debt is 300M, but the firm's value (EV) is 250M, then the total market value of debt might be 250M? Wait, but EV is the value of the firm, so if the firm's assets are worth 250M, then the debt should be paid out of that. So the total debt of 300M would be paid back at 250M, so each tranche would trade at (250/300)*150M? Wait, no. Wait, if the total debt is 300M, but the firm's value is 250M, then the total market value of debt would be 250M. So each tranche, being equal, would trade at (250/300)*150M = 125M each. Wait, 250 total debt value divided by 300 face value, so the recovery rate is 250/300 = 5/6. So each tranche of 150M would trade at 150 * (5/6) = 125M.\n\nWait, but the question says \"each tranche at 150M\" – does that mean face value? So the face value of each is 150M, but the market value would be based on the recovery. So total recovery is 250M (since EV is 250M, which is the value available to pay debt), so total market value of debt is 250M. Therefore, each tranche, being equal, would be 250/2 = 125M. So each trades at 125M.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So each tranche of 150M face value would trade at 125M, since the total available to pay debt is 250M, so each gets half of that. So 250 divided by 2 tranches is 125 each.\n\nSo the answer should be 125M for each tranche.\n</think>\n\nThe firm's enterprise value (EV) of 250M is less than the total debt of 300M, indicating the debt will trade at a discount. The total market value of debt equals the EV (250M), so each equal tranche (150M face value) trades at 250M / 2 = 125M.\n\n<answer>:125M",

      "question": "Company X is currently valued at 5x EV/EBITDA and 5x P/E, while Company Y trades at 6x EV/EBITDA and 4x P/E. If X acquires Y, would the deal increase or decrease X's earnings per share?",
      "ground_truth": "Increase",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, Company X is valued at 5x EV/EBITDA and 5x P/E, while Company Y trades at 6x EV/EBITDA and 4x P/E. The question is whether acquiring Y would increase or decrease X's EPS.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what EPS is. Earnings Per Share is calculated as net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. So, for the acquisition to affect X's EPS, we need to consider the combined net income and the new number of shares after the acquisition.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't mention the size of the companies or the terms of the acquisition. Hmm. Maybe I need to use the valuation multiples to infer something about the relative earnings and values.\n\nEV/EBITDA is Enterprise Value over EBITDA. EV includes debt, cash, and equity, but EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. P/E is Price per Share over Earnings per Share.\n\nCompany X has a lower EV/EBITDA (5x) compared to Y (6x), which might suggest X is cheaper relative to EBITDA. But Y has a lower P/E (4x) than X (5x), meaning Y's earnings are cheaper relative to its share price.\n\nWait, if X is acquiring Y, we need to see if the acquisition is accretive or dilutive to EPS. Accretive means EPS increases, dilutive means it decreases.\n\nTypically, if the acquiring company (X) has a higher P/E than the target (Y), then acquiring Y would be accretive because X is paying more for earnings (higher P/E) than Y's earnings are priced at (lower P/E). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf X's P/E is 5x and Y's P/E is 4x, that means X's shares are trading at 5 times its earnings, while Y's are at 4 times. So Y is cheaper in terms of P/E. If X buys Y, and X's P/E is higher than Y's, then the acquisition would be accretive. Because X is using its higher-priced shares (higher P/E) to buy a company with lower P/E, so the combined earnings per share would be higher.\n\nWait, the formula for EPS accretion/dilution: If the acquirer's P/E is higher than the target's P/E, then the acquisition is accretive. Because the acquirer is paying more per dollar of earnings than the target's earnings are priced at. So, for example, if X has a P/E of 5 and Y has a P/E of 4, then X is paying 5 times Y's earnings to acquire Y. But since Y's earnings are priced at 4x, X's higher P/E means that the acquisition would add more earnings per share than the dilution from issuing shares.\n\nWait, but the exact calculation might depend on the exchange ratio. However, since the problem doesn't give specific numbers, we have to go by the P/E multiples.\n\nAnother way: If the acquirer's P/E is higher than the target's P/E, then the acquisition is accretive. So X's P/E is 5, Y's is 4. Since 5 > 4, X's P/E is higher, so acquiring Y (with lower P/E) would be accretive. Therefore, EPS would increase.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Suppose X has a P/E of 5, so for every dollar of earnings, X's stock is worth $5. Y has a P/E of 4, so for every dollar of earnings, Y's stock is worth $4. If X buys Y, X is paying $5 per dollar of Y's earnings (since Y's earnings are priced at $4 per share, but X's P/E is 5, so the implied price for Y's earnings would be based on X's P/E). Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nAlternatively, the key point is that if the acquirer's P/E is higher than the target's, then the acquisition is accretive. So X's P/E (5) > Y's P/E (4), so the deal should be accretive, meaning EPS increases.\n\nYes, that's the standard rule. For example, if a company with a high P/E acquires a company with a low P/E, the combined P/E will be lower, and EPS will increase. So the answer should be that the deal would increase X's EPS.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if X's EPS increases upon acquiring Y, compare their P/E ratios. X trades at 5x P/E, Y at 4x P/E. Since X's P/E (5) is higher than Y's (4), acquiring Y (with a lower P/E) is accretive. This means X's earnings per share will increase as the higher-priced earnings of X absorb Y's lower-priced earnings.\n\n<answer>:increase",

      "question": "You acquire a firm for 80 million at a 10x EBITDA multiple, financed with 60% debt at a 5% interest rate. You hold the company for 5 years and exit at a 9x multiple, with zero EBITDA growth and 2 million of annual capital expenditure. For the 5-year hold, what is the MOIC, IRR, and the first-year LFCF yield?",
      "ground_truth": "1.3x MOIC, 6% IRR, 11.25% LFCF yield",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. The user wants to know the MOIC, IRR, and first-year LFCF yield for a firm they acquired. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, they acquired the firm for $80 million at a 10x EBITDA multiple. So, the EBITDA at acquisition must be $80 million divided by 10, which is $8 million. That makes sense because EBITDA multiple = Enterprise Value / EBITDA, so EBITDA = EV / multiple.\n\nFinanced with 60% debt at 5% interest. So, debt is 60% of $80 million, which is $48 million. Equity would be $32 million. But I need to check if the debt is interest-only or if there's amortization. The problem doesn't mention principal repayment, so I'll assume interest-only for simplicity, meaning the debt balance stays at $48 million over the 5 years.\n\nThey hold for 5 years, exit at 9x multiple, zero EBITDA growth, and $2 million annual capital expenditure. Zero EBITDA growth means EBITDA stays at $8 million for all 5 years. Capital expenditure (CapEx) is $2 million each year, which affects free cash flow.\n\nNow, let's compute the exit value. Exit multiple is 9x EBITDA, so exit EV = 9 * $8 million = $72 million. But wait, the exit value is the enterprise value, so we need to subtract the debt to get equity value. However, the problem doesn't specify if the debt is paid off at exit. Since it's a 5-year hold and the debt was financed at 60%, I think we assume the debt is repaid at exit. So, exit equity value = exit EV - debt. But the debt was $48 million, and if it's interest-only, the principal is still $48 million at exit. So exit equity = $72 million - $48 million = $24 million.\n\nWait, but the initial equity was $32 million (40% of $80 million). So the equity value at exit is $24 million. But let's confirm: initial equity investment is $32 million (since 40% equity, 60% debt). Exit equity value is exit EV minus debt. Exit EV is 9x EBITDA = $72 million. Debt is still $48 million (assuming no repayment during hold), so exit equity = $72M - $48M = $24M. So the equity value decreased from $32M to $24M? That seems odd, but maybe because the multiple decreased from 10x to 9x, and EBITDA didn't grow.\n\nNow, MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) is exit equity value divided by initial equity investment. So $24 million / $32 million = 0.75. So MOIC is 0.75x.\n\nNext, IRR. To calculate IRR, we need the cash flows. The initial investment is -$32 million (equity). Then, each year, there's free cash flow. But the problem mentions annual capital expenditure of $2 million. So, operating cash flow would be EBITDA minus CapEx, but EBITDA is $8 million, CapEx is $2 million, so FCF = $8M - $2M = $6 million per year. But wait, is that before or after interest? Wait, LFCF (Levered Free Cash Flow) is after interest payments. Wait, the problem says \"LFCF yield\", so levered free cash flow.\n\nWait, levered free cash flow is typically calculated as net income + depreciation - CapEx + changes in working capital, but here, since we have EBITDA, maybe it's EBITDA - CapEx - interest. But the problem states \"2 million of annual capital expenditure\", so maybe they mean that the FCF is EBITDA minus CapEx, but we need to adjust for interest because it's levered.\n\nWait, the problem says \"first-year LFCF yield\", so levered free cash flow. LFCF is usually after interest payments. So, let's clarify.\n\nEBITDA = $8 million (constant over 5 years).\n\nInterest expense: debt is $48 million at 5%, so annual interest = $48M * 5% = $2.4 million.\n\nSo, EBIT = EBITDA - depreciation, but since we don't have depreciation, maybe we can assume EBITDA is the same as EBIT for simplicity? Wait, no, EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. So EBIT would be EBITDA minus depreciation. But the problem doesn't mention depreciation, so perhaps we can ignore it, or assume it's zero. So EBIT = EBITDA = $8 million.\n\nBut for LFCF, it's typically: EBITDA - CapEx - interest - taxes. But taxes aren't mentioned, so maybe we assume no taxes (or tax rate is zero). So LFCF = EBITDA - CapEx - interest.\n\nSo, LFCF = $8M - $2M - $2.4M = $3.6 million per year.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"2 million of annual capital expenditure\", so CapEx is $2 million. So yes, LFCF = EBITDA - CapEx - interest = 8 - 2 - 2.4 = $3.6 million.\n\nSo first-year LFCF is $3.6 million. The LFCF yield is LFCF divided by the initial equity investment? Or divided by the equity value? Wait, yield is usually annual cash flow divided by the investment. So first-year LFCF yield = LFCF / initial equity investment = $3.6 million / $32 million = 0.1125 or 11.25%.\n\nBut let's confirm. The initial equity investment is $32 million. The first-year LFCF is $3.6 million, so yield is 3.6 / 32 = 11.25%.\n\nNow, for IRR, we need to model the cash flows. The initial outflow is -$32 million. Then, each year, the LFCF is $3.6 million (assuming it's constant over 5 years, since EBITDA is constant, CapEx constant, interest constant). At the end of year 5, we get the exit equity value of $24 million.\n\nWait, but the exit equity value is $24 million, which is the cash received at exit. So the cash flows would be:\n\nYear 0: -$32 million\n\nYears 1-4: +$3.6 million each year\n\nYear 5: +$3.6 million (LFCF) + $24 million (exit) = $27.6 million\n\nWait, but is the exit value received at the end of year 5, so the last cash flow is year 5: $3.6M + $24M = $27.6M.\n\nSo the cash flows are:\n\n-32, 3.6, 3.6, 3.6, 3.6, 27.6\n\nNow, to calculate IRR, we need to find the discount rate that makes the NPV of these cash flows equal to zero.\n\nLet me compute this. Using a financial calculator or Excel's IRR function.\n\nLet's list the cash flows:\n\nYear 0: -32\n\nYear 1: 3.6\n\nYear 2: 3.6\n\nYear 3: 3.6\n\nYear 4: 3.6\n\nYear 5: 27.6\n\nSo, the IRR can be calculated as follows. Let's approximate.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for IRR. But since it's a bit complex, maybe use trial and error.\n\nLet's try 5%:\n\nNPV = -32 + 3.6/(1.05) + 3.6/(1.05)^2 + 3.6/(1.05)^3 + 3.6/(1.05)^4 + 27.6/(1.05)^5\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n3.6 / 1.05 = 3.4286\n\n3.6 / 1.1025 = 3.2653\n\n3.6 / 1.1576 = 3.1098\n\n3.6 / 1.2155 = 2.9627\n\n27.6 / 1.2763 = 21.625\n\nSum of positive terms: 3.4286 + 3.2653 + 3.1098 + 2.9627 + 21.625 ≈ 34.3914\n\nNPV = 34.3914 - 32 = 2.3914 > 0, so IRR > 5%.\n\nTry 10%:\n\n3.6 / 1.1 = 3.2727\n\n3.6 / 1.21 = 2.9752\n\n3.6 / 1.331 = 2.705\n\n3.6 / 1.4641 = 2.459\n\n27.6 / 1.6105 = 17.137\n\nSum: 3.2727 + 2.9752 + 2.705 + 2.459 + 17.137 ≈ 28.55\n\nNPV = 28.55 - 32 = -3.45 < 0\n\nSo IRR is between 5% and 10%. Let's try 7%.\n\n7%:\n\n3.6 / 1.07 = 3.3645\n\n3.6 / 1.1449 = 3.144\n\n3.6 / 1.2250 = 2.9388\n\n3.6 / 1.3108 = 2.746\n\n27.6 / 1.4026 = 19.677\n\nSum: 3.3645 + 3.144 + 2.9388 + 2.746 + 19.677 ≈ 31.87\n\nNPV = 31.87 - 32 = -0.13 ≈ 0. So IRR is approximately 7%.\n\nWait, let's check with 6.9%.\n\nBut maybe the exact IRR is around 7%. Let's use a calculator.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for IRR. But since this is a thought process, I'll approximate.\n\nAnother way: the cash flows are -32, 3.6, 3.6, 3.6, 3.6, 27.6.\n\nUsing Excel's IRR function, the IRR would be approximately 6.9% or 7%.\n\nBut let's confirm with another method. Let's use the present value of the cash flows.\n\nAlternatively, since the exit value is lower than the initial equity, the IRR might be negative? Wait, no, because the annual cash flows are positive. Initial investment is $32M, exit equity is $24M, but with $3.6M each year for 5 years.\n\nWait, the total cash inflows: 4*3.6 + 27.6 = 14.4 + 27.6 = 42 million. So total inflow is $42M, outflow $32M, so it's positive, so IRR should be positive.\n\nWait, 3.6*4 = 14.4, plus 27.6 is 42. So yes, total inflow is 42, outflow 32, so IRR positive.\n\nEarlier calculation at 7% gave NPV ≈ -0.13, so very close to 7%. Let's say approximately 7%.\n\nBut let's check with 6.9%.\n\nYear 1: 3.6 / 1.069 ≈ 3.368\n\nYear 2: 3.6 / (1.069)^2 ≈ 3.6 / 1.14276 ≈ 3.151\n\nYear 3: 3.6 / (1.069)^3 ≈ 3.6 / 1.221 ≈ 2.948\n\nYear 4: 3.6 / (1.069)^4 ≈ 3.6 / 1.305 ≈ 2.759\n\nYear 5: 27.6 / (1.069)^5 ≈ 27.6 / 1.394 ≈ 19.8\n\nSum: 3.368 + 3.151 + 2.948 + 2.759 + 19.8 ≈ 32.026\n\nSo NPV ≈ 32.026 - 32 = 0.026, so IRR is approximately 6.9%.\n\nSo rounding to two decimal places, maybe 6.9% or 7.0%.\n\nBut in finance, sometimes they round to the nearest whole number or one decimal. Let's say 7.0%.\n\nNow, MOIC is 24 / 32 = 0.75x.\n\nFirst-year LFCF yield: LFCF / initial equity = 3.6 / 32 = 0.1125 or 11.25%.\n\nWait, but let's confirm LFCF calculation again.\n\nEBITDA = $8M\n\nCapEx = $2M\n\nInterest = $48M * 5% = $2.4M\n\nAssuming no taxes, LFCF = EBITDA - CapEx - Interest = 8 - 2 - 2.4 = 3.6M. Yes.\n\nSo LFCF yield = 3.6 / 32 = 11.25%.\n\nNow, check if the exit value is correctly calculated.\n\nExit EV = 9x EBITDA = 9*8 = $72M.\n\nDebt at exit: still $48M (assuming no repayment), so equity value = 72 - 48 = $24M. Correct.\n\nInitial equity: 40% of 80M = $32M. Correct.\n\nSo MOIC = 24 / 32 = 0.75x.\n\nIRR: approximately 7%.\n\nLFCF yield: 11.25%.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"first-year LFCF yield\". So it's the yield based on the first year's LFCF divided by the initial investment. So 3.6 / 32 = 11.25%.\n\nNow, let's make sure all numbers are correct.\n\nAnother check: if EBITDA is $8M, and it's constant, then yes, exit EBITDA is still $8M, so exit EV 9*8=72.\n\nDebt is 60% of 80M = 48M, so debt remains 48M (interest-only), so exit equity is 72-48=24.\n\nInitial equity 32.\n\nMOIC 24/32=0.75.\n\nLFCF: EBITDA - CapEx - Interest = 8 - 2 - 2.4 = 3.6.\n\nLFCF yield: 3.6 / 32 = 11.25%.\n\nIRR: as calculated, approximately 7%.\n\nSo the final answers should be:\n\nMOIC: 0.75x\n\nIRR: 7.0% (or 6.9%, but likely rounded to 7%)\n\nLFCF Yield: 11.25%\n\nWait, but the problem says \"first-year LFCF yield\", which is typically LFCF divided by the equity investment, so 3.6/32=11.25%.\n\nNow, check if the problem mentions \"zero EBITDA growth\", so EBITDA stays at $8M, which we used.\n\nCapital expenditure is $2 million annually, which we subtracted.\n\nInterest is 5% on $48M, so $2.4M, correct.\n\nSo all steps seem correct.\n\nNow, the required format: MOIC, IRR, and first-year LFCF yield.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nMOIC: 0.75x\n\nIRR: 7.0%\n\nLFCF Yield: 11.25%\n\nBut need to present in the required format. The problem says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\".\n\nProbably list them as:\n\nMOIC: 0.75x, IRR: 7.0%, LFCF Yield: 11.25%\n\nBut check if the IRR should be more precise. Since in the calculation, it's approximately 6.9%, but often rounded to one decimal, so 6.9% or 7.0%. Given that at 7% the NPV was -0.13, and at 6.9% it's +0.026, so closer to 6.9%. But maybe the problem expects a rounded figure. In many cases, IRR is reported to one decimal place, so 6.9% or 7.0%.\n\nBut let's see if there's a standard way. Alternatively, use the exact calculation.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for IRR with the cash flows.\n\nBut since this is a thought process, and the user expects a concise answer, I'll go with 7.0% as a rounded figure.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nMOIC: 0.75x, IRR: 7.0%, LFCF Yield: 11.25%\n\nBut the problem says \"in the correct financial format\", so probably using x for MOIC, % for IRR and yield.\n\nNow, check if the LFCF yield is annual, so 11.25% is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nMOIC: 0.75x, IRR: 7.0%, LFCF Yield: 11.25%\n\nBut the problem might want them listed in order as per the question: MOIC, IRR, and first-year LFCF yield.\n\nSo the final answer should be those three values.\n\nNow, the instructions say to end with '<answer>: ...' so I need to format it as:\n\n<answer>: 0.75x, 7.0%, 11.25%\n\nBut check if commas are needed. The problem says \"concise\", so probably separated by commas.\n\nYes, that's standard.\n\nSo the final answer is 0.75x, 7.0%, 11.25%\n</think>\n\n<answer>: 0.75x, 7.0%, 11.25%",

      "question": "You purchase a company for 150M at a 15x EBITDA multiple, hold it for 5 years without EBITDA growth, then exit at a 15x multiple. The investment is bought at 50% LTV with 4% cost of debt. You also spend 2M on capital expenditures annually. What are the MOIC and IRR of the deal? Assume add debt is paid down at exit and you only have access to a basic calculator.",
      "ground_truth": "MOIC: 1.33x, IRR: 6%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. The user wants to know the MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return) for a company acquisition. Let me break down all the given information first.\n\nSo, the company is purchased for $150 million at a 15x EBITDA multiple. That means the EBITDA at purchase must be $150M / 15 = $10 million. Got that. They hold it for 5 years without EBITDA growth, so EBITDA stays at $10 million each year. Then they exit at the same 15x multiple, so exit value is 15 * $10M = $150 million.\n\nThe investment is bought at 50% LTV (Loan-to-Value), so the debt is 50% of $150M, which is $75 million. The cost of debt is 4%, so annual interest expense is $75M * 4% = $3 million per year. But wait, they also spend $2 million on capital expenditures annually. Hmm, but since EBITDA isn't growing, does that affect the cash flow? Wait, EBITDA is the starting point, and capital expenditures are subtracted to get free cash flow. But the problem says \"without EBITDA growth,\" so EBITDA remains constant. However, capital expenditures are a cash outflow, so they reduce the cash flow available to the equity holder.\n\nWait, but the question is about MOIC and IRR. Let's recall that MOIC is total proceeds divided by equity invested. IRR is the annualized return based on cash flows.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the equity investment. Since it's 50% LTV, equity is 50% of $150M, so $75 million. But wait, the debt is $75M, so equity is $75M. But they also have to pay interest on the debt each year. The debt is paid down at exit, so over the 5 years, they must be paying down the principal. Wait, the problem says \"add debt is paid down at exit,\" which probably means the debt is paid off in full at exit, so no principal payments during the holding period. Wait, but if it's a 5-year hold, and debt is paid down at exit, that implies that the debt is amortized over the 5 years, but the problem states \"assume add debt is paid down at exit,\" so maybe the debt is paid off entirely at the end of year 5. So during the 5 years, they're only paying interest, not principal. So annual interest is $3M (4% of $75M), and they have to pay that each year.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"you also spend 2M on capital expenditures annually.\" So each year, they have $2M in CapEx. But how does that affect the cash flow? Let's think about the cash flows to equity.\n\nStarting with the purchase: Equity invested is $75M (since 50% LTV on $150M purchase price). So initial equity outlay is $75M.\n\nNow, each year, the company generates EBITDA of $10M. But they have to pay interest on debt ($3M), and CapEx ($2M). Wait, but EBITDA is before interest and taxes, so EBITDA is $10M. Then, to get to free cash flow (FCF), you subtract CapEx. But interest is a financing cost, so it's not subtracted from EBITDA to get FCF. Wait, FCF is EBITDA minus CapEx minus taxes, but since taxes aren't mentioned, maybe we can ignore them. So FCF = EBITDA - CapEx = $10M - $2M = $8M per year. But then, the interest expense is paid from the FCF, right? Wait, no. The interest is a cash outflow that's separate from CapEx. So the company's cash flow would be EBITDA, then subtract interest (to get EBT), but for FCF, it's EBITDA minus CapEx minus taxes. But since taxes aren't mentioned, maybe we assume no taxes. So FCF = EBITDA - CapEx = $10M - $2M = $8M per year. But the interest expense is paid from the company's cash, so the cash available to equity holders would be FCF minus interest? Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nThe company's cash flow from operations is EBITDA minus taxes (but taxes are zero here), so $10M. Then, CapEx is $2M, so free cash flow to the firm is $10M - $2M = $8M. But the firm has to pay interest on debt, which is $3M per year. So the cash flow available to equity holders would be FCF minus interest, because interest is a payment to debt holders. Wait, no. The interest is paid from the company's cash, so the company's cash flow is EBITDA - CapEx = $8M, but they have to pay $3M in interest, so the cash left for equity is $8M - $3M = $5M per year. Wait, but actually, the interest is a financing cost, so it's paid after operating cash flow. So operating cash flow (OCF) is EBITDA - taxes = $10M (assuming no taxes), then CapEx is $2M, so FCF = OCF - CapEx = $8M. Then, the interest is paid from the FCF, so the cash available to equity is FCF - interest = $8M - $3M = $5M per year. But wait, actually, the interest is a cash outflow that's separate, so the company's cash flow is EBITDA, then they pay interest and CapEx. So EBITDA is $10M, pay $3M interest, pay $2M CapEx, so remaining cash is $5M, which goes to equity. So yes, $5M per year to equity.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"you also spend 2M on capital expenditures annually.\" So that's a cash outflow, so it's subtracted from the EBITDA. So the annual cash flow to equity is EBITDA - interest - CapEx = $10M - $3M - $2M = $5M per year. That seems right.\n\nNow, over 5 years, they receive $5M each year. At exit, they sell the company for $150M (15x EBITDA), but they have to pay off the debt of $75M. So the equity proceeds at exit are $150M - $75M = $75M.\n\nWait, but the debt is paid down at exit, so the exit value is $150M, minus the debt of $75M, so equity gets $75M.\n\nNow, let's outline the cash flows:\n\n- Year 0: Equity investment of $75M (outflow)\n- Years 1-5: Annual cash inflows of $5M each year (from the $5M per year)\n- Year 5: Additional cash inflow of $75M (from exit proceeds after debt repayment)\n\nWait, but the exit happens at the end of year 5, so the $75M is received at the end of year 5, along with the year 5 cash flow. So total cash flow at year 5 is $5M (annual) + $75M (exit) = $80M.\n\nWait, no. The annual cash flows are $5M each year, including year 5. Then, at exit, the company is sold, so the equity gets the exit value minus debt. So the $5M for year 5 is the operating cash flow for year 5, and then the exit proceeds are separate. So yes, year 5 has $5M (from operations) plus $75M (exit), totaling $80M.\n\nBut let's confirm:\n\n- Purchase price: $150M\n- Debt: $75M (50% LTV)\n- Equity: $75M\n\nEach year:\n- EBITDA: $10M\n- Interest: $3M (4% of $75M)\n- CapEx: $2M\n- So cash flow to equity: $10M - $3M - $2M = $5M per year (for 5 years)\n\nAt exit:\n- Exit value: $150M (15x EBITDA)\n- Debt paid off: $75M\n- Equity proceeds: $150M - $75M = $75M\n\nSo the cash flows are:\n- Year 0: -$75M\n- Year 1: +$5M\n- Year 2: +$5M\n- Year 3: +$5M\n- Year 4: +$5M\n- Year 5: +$5M + $75M = +$80M\n\nNow, to calculate MOIC: Total proceeds / Equity invested.\n\nTotal proceeds to equity: sum of all cash inflows = $5M * 5 + $75M = $25M + $75M = $100M.\n\nWait, no. The $75M is the exit proceeds, and the $5M each year is the annual cash flow. So total proceeds are $5M * 5 + $75M = $25M + $75M = $100M.\n\nEquity invested is $75M.\n\nSo MOIC = $100M / $75M = 1.333..., which is 1.33x.\n\nWait, but let's check: the exit proceeds are $75M, and the annual cash flows are $5M each year for 5 years. So total cash received is $5*5 + $75 = $25 + $75 = $100. Equity invested was $75, so MOIC is 100/75 = 1.333.\n\nNow, for IRR. We need to find the discount rate that makes the NPV of these cash flows equal to zero.\n\nCash flows:\n- Year 0: -75\n- Year 1: +5\n- Year 2: +5\n- Year 3: +5\n- Year 4: +5\n- Year 5: +80\n\nSo the IRR is the rate r where:\n\n-75 + 5/(1+r) + 5/(1+r)^2 + 5/(1+r)^3 + 5/(1+r)^4 + 80/(1+r)^5 = 0\n\nThis is a bit tricky to calculate without a financial calculator, but since the problem says \"assume you only have access to a basic calculator,\" we need to approximate it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let's compute the total cash flows. The equity investment is $75M. The total cash received is $100M, so the total return is $25M over 5 years. But IRR is not just total return divided by years; it's compounded.\n\nBut let's try to approximate. Let's see what the IRR might be.\n\nIf we ignore the annual $5M and just look at the $75M exit, the return would be (75/75)^(1/5) -1 = 0%, but that's not right because there's also the $5M each year.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the cash flows as an annuity of $5M for 5 years plus a lump sum of $75M at year 5.\n\nThe present value of the annuity is 5 * [1 - 1/(1+r)^5]/r\n\nThe present value of the lump sum is 75/(1+r)^5\n\nSo total PV = 5 * [1 - 1/(1+r)^5]/r + 75/(1+r)^5 = 75\n\nSo 5 * [1 - 1/(1+r)^5]/r + 75/(1+r)^5 = 75\n\nLet's rearrange:\n\n5 * [1 - 1/(1+r)^5]/r = 75 - 75/(1+r)^5\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n[1 - 1/(1+r)^5]/r = 15 - 15/(1+r)^5\n\nLet’s denote x = 1/(1+r)^5, so the equation becomes:\n\n(1 - x)/r = 15(1 - x)\n\nAssuming 1 - x ≠ 0 (which it isn't, since r > 0), we can divide both sides by (1 - x):\n\n1/r = 15\n\nSo r = 1/15 ≈ 6.67%\n\nWait, that's a neat trick. Let's check that.\n\nIf (1 - x)/r = 15(1 - x), then if 1 - x ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by (1 - x), getting 1/r = 15, so r = 1/15 ≈ 6.67%.\n\nSo the IRR is approximately 6.67%.\n\nLet me verify with r = 6.67%.\n\nCompute the present value of the annuity:\n\n5 * [1 - 1/(1.0667)^5]/0.0667\n\nFirst, (1.0667)^5 ≈ let's calculate:\n\n1.0667^2 ≈ 1.1378\n\n1.0667^3 ≈ 1.1378 * 1.0667 ≈ 1.214\n\n1.0667^4 ≈ 1.214 * 1.0667 ≈ 1.295\n\n1.0667^5 ≈ 1.295 * 1.0667 ≈ 1.381\n\nSo 1/(1.0667)^5 ≈ 0.724\n\nThen, [1 - 0.724]/0.0667 ≈ 0.276 / 0.0667 ≈ 4.137\n\nSo annuity PV ≈ 5 * 4.137 ≈ 20.685\n\nLump sum PV: 75 / 1.381 ≈ 54.31\n\nTotal PV ≈ 20.685 + 54.31 ≈ 75, which matches the initial investment. So yes, the IRR is approximately 6.67%.\n\nSo MOIC is 1.33x, IRR is 6.67%.\n\nWait, but let's confirm the MOIC. Total proceeds to equity are $100M (5*5 +75), equity invested is $75M, so 100/75 = 1.333..., which is 1.33x.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final answer should be MOIC: 1.33x, IRR: 6.67%.\n\nBut let's check if the annual cash flow is correct. The problem says \"you also spend 2M on capital expenditures annually.\" So CapEx is $2M per year, which is subtracted from EBITDA to get FCF. But EBITDA is $10M, so FCF is $10M - $2M = $8M. Then, interest is $3M, so the cash available to equity is $8M - $3M = $5M. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way: The company's cash flow before interest and CapEx is EBITDA ($10M). They pay interest ($3M) and CapEx ($2M), so the remaining cash is $5M, which goes to equity. Yes.\n\nAt exit, the company is sold for $150M, debt is $75M, so equity gets $75M. So the exit proceeds are $75M, which is the same as the initial equity investment. But they also received $5M each year for 5 years, so total equity return is $75M (exit) + $25M (annual) = $100M, which is $25M profit on $75M invested, so MOIC is 100/75 = 1.33x.\n\nIRR calculation checks out with the approximation method, giving 6.67%.\n\nSo the final answer should be MOIC of 1.33x and IRR of 6.67%.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:1.33x, 6.67%",

      "question": "A soda company sells each beverage for $8 while spending $3 to produce each drink. They typically sell 900 drinks per month. If they switch to a membership plan offering 4 drinks a month, what should the monthly fee be to hold the same profit?",
      "ground_truth": "$17",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the soda company sells each drink for $8 and spends $3 to produce it. They sell 900 drinks per month normally. Now, they want to switch to a membership plan where members get 4 drinks a month, and we need to find the monthly fee that would keep the same profit.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out their current profit. Profit is calculated as (selling price - cost price) multiplied by the number of units sold. So, per drink, the profit is $8 - $3 = $5. Then, for 900 drinks, the total profit would be 900 * $5 = $4,500 per month.\n\nNow, under the new membership plan, each member gets 4 drinks a month. To maintain the same total profit of $4,500, the monthly fee needs to cover that. But wait, how many members would they need? Wait, actually, the problem says \"hold the same profit,\" so the total revenue from the membership fees should equal the previous total profit. Wait, no. Wait, the previous profit was $4,500. But the new plan's fee should generate the same profit, considering the cost of producing the drinks.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify. The current profit is (8-3)*900 = 5*900 = 4500. So, they make $4,500 profit each month.\n\nUnder the new plan, each member pays a monthly fee, and in return, they get 4 drinks. The company still has to produce those 4 drinks, so the cost per member would be 4 * $3 = $12. But the fee they charge per member should cover the cost of the drinks plus the desired profit. Wait, no. Wait, the profit from the membership plan should equal the previous profit.\n\nWait, the previous profit was $4,500. So, the new plan's total profit should also be $4,500. But the new plan's profit would be (monthly fee - cost per member) * number of members. Wait, but how many members are there?\n\nWait, the problem states that they typically sell 900 drinks per month. Under the new plan, each member gets 4 drinks a month. So, the number of members needed to sell 900 drinks would be 900 / 4 = 225 members. Because each member buys 4 drinks, so 225 members * 4 drinks = 900 drinks.\n\nSo, the company would have 225 members. Each member pays a monthly fee, say F. The total revenue from fees is 225 * F. The cost to produce the drinks is 900 * $3 = $2,700 (since 900 drinks total, each costing $3). The profit would be total revenue minus total cost. So, profit = 225F - 2700. We want this profit to equal the previous profit of $4,500.\n\nSo, set up the equation: 225F - 2700 = 4500.\n\nSolving for F: 225F = 4500 + 2700 = 7200. Then F = 7200 / 225 = 32.\n\nWait, let me check that. 225 times 32: 200*32=6400, 25*32=800, so total 7200. Yes. So the monthly fee should be $32.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Previous profit was $4,500. New profit should be same. So total revenue from fees minus cost of production equals $4,500. Cost of production is 900*3=2700. So total revenue needed is 4500 + 2700 = 7200. Then, since there are 225 members (900/4), each pays 7200 / 225 = 32. So yes, $32.\n\nAlternatively, per drink, the profit was $5. But under the new plan, each drink is still costing $3 to produce, so the profit per drink is still $5. Wait, but the fee is for 4 drinks. So per drink, the fee would need to cover the $3 cost plus $5 profit, so $8 per drink. But 4 drinks would be 4*8=32. Oh, that's a simpler way. Since each drink was contributing $5 profit, and now each member gets 4 drinks, so the fee should be 4 drinks * $8 (the original selling price) but wait, no. Wait, the original selling price was $8 per drink, which included the $5 profit. So if they want the same profit per drink, then for 4 drinks, the fee should be 4 * $8 = $32. But wait, but the cost is $3 per drink, so 4 drinks cost $12, and the fee is $32, so profit per member is 32 - 12 = $20. Then total profit is 225 members * $20 = $4,500, which matches. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be $32.\n</think>\n\nThe company currently makes a profit of ($8 - $3) * 900 = $4,500 per month. Under the membership plan, each member receives 4 drinks, so 900 drinks require 900 / 4 = 225 members. To maintain the same profit, total revenue from fees must cover the cost of production ($3 * 900 = $2,700) plus the desired profit ($4,500), totaling $7,200. The monthly fee per member is $7,200 / 225 = $32.\n\n<answer>:$32",

      "ground_truth": "20",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about a private equity group that acquired a gadget-maker via LBO. They want to know how many gadgets they need to sell in year 5 to reach a 25% IRR. The deal uses 25% debt financing, and there are several other details given.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what IRR (Internal Rate of Return) means. It's the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows equal to zero. But the problem mentions that a 3x MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) corresponds to a 25% IRR. MOIC is the total return divided by the initial investment. So, if MOIC is 3x, that means the exit value is three times the initial equity investment. And this 3x MOIC is equivalent to a 25% IRR over the 5-year period. So, I can use this to find the required exit value.\n\nLet me list out the given information:\n\n- First year sales: 12 gadgets\n- EBITDA in first year: 60\n- Bought at 9x EBITDA multiple\n- Exited at 10x EBITDA multiple after 5 years\n- Debt financing: 25% of the purchase price\n- Annual non-gadget revenue: 120\n- Initial EBITDA margin: 25%\n- Gadget prices rise by $4 in year 5\n- Final EBITDA margin: 25%\n- Cash at exit: 350\n\nWait, the problem says \"the company starts with EBITDA of 60\". So, the initial EBITDA is 60. The initial EBITDA margin is 25%, so total revenue would be EBITDA / margin = 60 / 0.25 = 240. But they mention annual non-gadget revenue is 120. So, the gadget revenue must be 240 - 120 = 120. Since they sold 12 gadgets in the first year, the price per gadget would be 120 / 12 = $10 per gadget.\n\nBut in year 5, gadget prices rise by $4, so the price becomes $14 per gadget. Wait, but the problem says \"gadget prices rise by $4 in year 5\", so the price in year 5 is original price + $4. Original price was $10, so year 5 price is $14.\n\nNow, the EBITDA margin remains 25% in the final year. So, the final EBITDA can be calculated based on the final revenue.\n\nLet me structure this.\n\nFirst, calculate the purchase price. The company is bought at a 9x EBITDA multiple. Initial EBITDA is 60, so purchase price = 9 * 60 = $540.\n\nDebt financing is 25%, so debt = 0.25 * 540 = $135. Therefore, equity investment = 540 - 135 = $405.\n\nThe exit multiple is 10x EBITDA. Let EBITDA in year 5 be E. Then exit value = 10 * E.\n\nBut the exit value should be such that MOIC is 3x. MOIC = Exit Value / Equity Invested. So, Exit Value = 3 * 405 = $1,215.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"a 3x MOIC corresponds to a 25% IRR\". So, the exit value (after debt repayment) should be 3x the equity investment. Wait, but in LBOs, the exit value is the enterprise value (EV), which is the value of the company before debt. So, the equity value at exit would be EV - debt. But the problem says \"the firm finishes the period with 350 in cash\". Hmm, maybe the cash is part of the exit proceeds.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The exit EV is 10x EBITDA. The EV is the value of the company, which includes debt and equity. But when calculating the return to equity, we need to subtract the debt. However, the problem states that the firm finishes with $350 in cash. So, perhaps the cash is part of the equity value.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the firm finishes the period with 350 in cash\". So, at exit, the company has $350 in cash. But the cash is part of the equity value. So, the equity value at exit would be the EV minus debt plus cash? Wait, no. EV is Enterprise Value = Equity Value + Debt - Cash. So, Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nBut the problem states that the firm finishes with $350 in cash. So, cash is $350. So, Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nBut let's see. The exit EV is 10x EBITDA. Let's denote EBITDA in year 5 as E. So, EV = 10 * E.\n\nThe debt at exit: the problem says the deal uses 25% debt financing. But does that mean the debt is fixed at 25% of the purchase price, or does it change over time? Typically, in LBOs, the debt is fixed at the time of acquisition, so the debt amount remains the same, but the company may pay down debt over time. However, the problem states \"the firm finishes the period with 350 in cash\", which might imply that the debt was paid down, and cash is $350.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the deal uses 25% debt financing\". So, the initial debt is 25% of the purchase price, which is $135. If the company uses cash to pay down debt, then the debt at exit would be less. But the problem states that the firm finishes with $350 in cash. So, perhaps the cash is after paying down debt.\n\nBut maybe the problem is simplified, and the debt is paid off, so the equity value at exit is EV - Debt + Cash. Wait, but EV is the enterprise value, which is the value of the company including debt. So, the equity value would be EV - Debt. But if the company has cash, then the equity value would be EV - Debt + Cash. Wait, no. EV = Equity Value + Debt - Cash. So, Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nGiven that, the equity value at exit should be equal to the initial equity investment times MOIC. Since MOIC is 3x, Equity Value = 3 * 405 = $1,215.\n\nSo, Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash = 1,215.\n\nWe know Cash = $350. EV = 10 * E (where E is EBITDA in year 5). Debt at exit: the problem says the deal uses 25% debt financing, but it's not clear if the debt is still outstanding at exit. However, the problem states \"the firm finishes the period with 350 in cash\", which suggests that the debt has been paid off, so Debt at exit is zero. Wait, but if they used 25% debt financing, maybe the debt is paid off over the 5 years. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that the debt is paid off, so Debt = 0 at exit. Then, Equity Value = EV + Cash.\n\nWait, but EV = 10 * E, and Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash. If Debt is paid off, then Debt = 0, so Equity Value = EV + Cash.\n\nGiven that Equity Value should be 3 * 405 = 1,215.\n\nSo, EV + Cash = 1,215.\n\nBut Cash is given as 350, so EV = 1,215 - 350 = 865.\n\nBut EV = 10 * E, so E = 865 / 10 = 86.5.\n\nSo, EBITDA in year 5 is $86.5.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of gadgets sold in year 5 to achieve this EBITDA.\n\nFirst, let's recall that EBITDA margin is 25% in the final year. So, EBITDA = Revenue * 0.25.\n\nTherefore, Revenue = EBITDA / 0.25 = 86.5 / 0.25 = $346.\n\nNow, the revenue comes from two parts: non-gadget revenue and gadget revenue.\n\nNon-gadget revenue is given as $120 annually. So, gadget revenue must be total revenue - non-gadget revenue = 346 - 120 = $226.\n\nThe price per gadget in year 5 is $4 higher than the initial price. Initial price: in year 1, they sold 12 gadgets for $120 (since total revenue from gadgets was 120, as EBITDA margin 25% implies total revenue 240, non-gadget 120, so gadgets 120). So, initial price per gadget = 120 / 12 = $10. Therefore, year 5 price = $10 + $4 = $14.\n\nSo, number of gadgets sold in year 5 = gadget revenue / price per gadget = 226 / 14 ≈ 16.14.\n\nWait, but the number of gadgets must be an integer. However, the problem might expect a decimal answer, or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's check the calculations again.\n\nTotal revenue in year 5: EBITDA / margin = 86.5 / 0.25 = 346.\n\nNon-gadget revenue: 120.\n\nGadget revenue: 346 - 120 = 226.\n\nPrice per gadget in year 5: $14.\n\nNumber of gadgets: 226 / 14 = 16.142857...\n\nSo, approximately 16.14 gadgets. But since you can't sell a fraction of a gadget, but the problem might accept the decimal.\n\nWait, but let's check if all the steps are correct.\n\nFirst, purchase price: 9x EBITDA = 9*60=540.\n\nDebt: 25% of 540 = 135. Equity: 540-135=405.\n\nExit EV: 10x EBITDA in year 5.\n\nMOIC 3x: Exit equity value = 3*405=1215.\n\nExit equity value = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nAssuming debt is paid off (since they have cash at exit), so Debt=0. Then, Equity value = EV + Cash.\n\nSo, EV + 350 = 1215 → EV = 865.\n\nEV = 10 * EBITDA → EBITDA = 86.5.\n\nEBITDA margin 25% → Revenue = 86.5 / 0.25 = 346.\n\nNon-gadget revenue: 120 → Gadget revenue: 346 - 120 = 226.\n\nGadget price in year 5: initial price was $10 (12 gadgets * $10 = $120), so +$4 → $14.\n\nNumber of gadgets: 226 / 14 = 16.142857...\n\nSo, approximately 16.14. But the question asks for \"how many gadgets must it sell\", so maybe round to the nearest whole number, but the problem might expect the exact decimal.\n\nWait, but let's check if the initial EBITDA margin is 25%, which we used to get total revenue. Let's confirm:\n\nInitial EBITDA = 60, margin 25%, so revenue = 60 / 0.25 = 240. Non-gadget revenue is 120, so gadget revenue is 120. 12 gadgets sold, so price per gadget = 120 / 12 = $10. Correct.\n\nYear 5 price: $10 + $4 = $14. Correct.\n\nGadget revenue needed: 226. So, 226 / 14 = 16.142857...\n\nSo, the answer should be approximately 16.14, but since the question is about the number of gadgets, which must be a whole number, but maybe they accept the decimal. However, in financial contexts, sometimes they expect rounding up, but the problem might just want the exact value.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's any mistake in the EV calculation.\n\nAnother way: The equity value at exit is 3x the initial equity. Initial equity was 405, so exit equity is 1215.\n\nThe company has 350 in cash at exit. So, the equity value is the cash plus the value of the business after debt. Wait, but if the debt was paid off, then the equity value is the EV (which includes the business value) plus cash. Wait, no. EV is the enterprise value, which is the value of the company's operations, so EV = Equity Value + Debt - Cash. So, Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nIf the debt is paid off, Debt = 0, so Equity Value = EV + Cash.\n\nWe have Equity Value = 1215, Cash = 350, so EV = 1215 - 350 = 865. Correct.\n\nEV = 10 * EBITDA → EBITDA = 86.5. Correct.\n\nRevenue = EBITDA / 0.25 = 346. Correct.\n\nGadget revenue = 346 - 120 = 226. Correct.\n\nPrice per gadget = 14. So, 226 / 14 = 16.142857...\n\nSo, the answer is approximately 16.14. But since the question says \"how many gadgets must it sell\", and you can't sell a fraction, but maybe in the context of the problem, they expect the exact decimal. The problem might not require rounding, so 16.14, but usually, in such problems, they might expect rounding to two decimal places or as a fraction.\n\nWait, but let's check if the EBITDA calculation is correct. The EBITDA margin is 25%, so EBITDA = Revenue * 0.25. So, Revenue = EBITDA / 0.25. So, 86.5 / 0.25 = 346. Correct.\n\nAnother check: If they sell 16 gadgets at $14, revenue is 16*14=224. Then total revenue would be 224 + 120 = 344. EBITDA would be 344 * 0.25 = 86. So, EV = 10*86=860. Then Equity Value = 860 + 350 = 1210. Which is slightly less than 1215. So, 16 gadgets would give 1210, which is 5 less than needed. So, 16.14 is needed.\n\nBut the problem might accept 16.14, or maybe they want it rounded to two decimal places. However, the problem says \"how many gadgets must it sell\", so perhaps the answer is 16.14, but in the context of the problem, maybe they expect it as a whole number, but the calculation shows it's approximately 16.14.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's any other factor I missed. For example, the debt repayment. Wait, the initial debt was $135. If they paid down debt over 5 years, but the problem states that the firm finishes with $350 in cash. So, the cash is $350, which might include the cash from operations minus debt repayment.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any interest or debt repayment schedule, so it's probably safe to assume that the debt is paid off, and the cash is $350. So, our previous calculation holds.\n\nAnother check: The initial EBITDA is 60, and they're exiting at 10x, so if EBITDA in year 5 is 86.5, then the exit EV is 865, which matches.\n\nSo, the number of gadgets is 226 / 14 = 16.142857...\n\nSo, the answer should be approximately 16.14. But since the question might expect a whole number, but the problem doesn't specify, and in financial calculations, decimals are acceptable for such quantities (even though you can't sell a fraction, the problem might just want the exact value).\n\nWait, the problem says \"how many gadgets must it sell\", so maybe they expect rounding up to 17, but the calculation shows 16.14. However, in the context of the problem, since it's a math problem, they probably want the exact value, so 16.14, but written as a decimal.\n\nBut let's see if there's a miscalculation. Let's recompute:\n\nGadget revenue needed: 226.\n\nPrice per gadget: 14.\n\n226 divided by 14: 14*16=224, so 226-224=2, so 16 + 2/14 = 16 + 1/7 ≈ 16.142857.\n\nYes, so 16.14.\n\nBut the problem might want it as a fraction, but the instructions say \"concise, in the correct financial format\". Financial format usually uses decimals, so 16.14.\n\nWait, but let's check if the EBITDA margin is maintained at 25% in year 5. The problem states \"the final EBITDA margin is 25%\", so yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother point: The problem says \"gadget prices rise by $4 in year 5\". So, the price in year 5 is $4 higher than the initial price. Initial price was $10, so $14. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps seem correct. Therefore, the answer is approximately 16.14 gadgets. Since the problem might expect rounding to two decimal places, it's 16.14.\n\nBut let's check if the problem says \"how many gadgets must it sell\", and in the context of the problem, maybe they want it as a whole number, but the calculation shows it's a fraction. However, in the absence of specific instructions to round, the precise answer is 16.14.\n\nWait, but let's check the MOIC part again. The problem states \"a 3x MOIC corresponds to a 25% IRR\". So, MOIC is exit equity value / initial equity. Exit equity value is 3 * 405 = 1215. Correct.\n\nExit equity value = EV - Debt + Cash. Assuming Debt is paid off, so Debt=0, so EV + Cash = 1215. EV = 10 * EBITDA. So, 10*EBITDA + 350 = 1215 → 10*EBITDA = 865 → EBITDA = 86.5. Correct.\n\nRevenue = 86.5 / 0.25 = 346. Correct.\n\nGadget revenue = 346 - 120 = 226. Correct.\n\nPrice per gadget = 10 + 4 = 14. Correct.\n\nNumber of gadgets = 226 / 14 = 16.142857...\n\nSo, the answer is 16.14. But maybe the problem expects it as a whole number, but given that it's a calculation, I think they want the decimal.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's a different interpretation. For example, maybe the EBITDA in year 5 is calculated differently. Let's confirm:\n\nEBITDA margin = EBITDA / Revenue = 25%, so EBITDA = 0.25 * Revenue.\n\nRevenue = non-gadget + gadget revenue.\n\nNon-gadget is 120, gadget revenue is (number of gadgets) * (price per gadget).\n\nPrice per gadget in year 5 is $14.\n\nSo, Revenue = 120 + 14 * N.\n\nEBITDA = 0.25 * (120 + 14N) = 30 + 3.5N.\n\nBut we also have EBITDA = 86.5.\n\nSo, 30 + 3.5N = 86.5 → 3.5N = 56.5 → N = 56.5 / 3.5 = 16.142857...\n\nYes, same result. So, N = 16.14.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 16.14.\n\nBut the problem says \"how many gadgets must it sell\", so the answer is 16.14. In financial terms, sometimes they round to two decimal places, so 16.14.\n\nBut let's check if the problem expects an integer. If it's a math problem, they might want the exact value, so 16.14.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the cash part. Let's re-examine the cash.\n\nThe problem states \"the firm finishes the period with 350 in cash\". So, cash is $350. In the equity value calculation, Equity Value = EV - Debt + Cash.\n\nIf the debt was paid off, Debt = 0, so Equity Value = EV + Cash.\n\nWe have Equity Value = 1215, Cash = 350, so EV = 1215 - 350 = 865. Correct.\n\nEV = 10 * EBITDA → EBITDA = 86.5. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of gadgets is 16.14.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:16.14",

      "question": "A financial sponsor acquires a business with EBITDA of $24 and an 10x purchase multiple, financed with a 2:1 debt-to-equity structure. Five years later, the sponsor exits when EBITDA is $40 at the same 10x multiple. Over the holding period, $70 of debt is fully paid down through free cash flow. What are the MOIC and IRR on the sponsor's equity?",
      "ground_truth": "3.875x MOICC, 31% IRR",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return) for a financial sponsor's equity investment. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, the sponsor acquires a business with an EBITDA of $24 and uses a 10x purchase multiple. The financing is a 2:1 debt-to-equity structure. Five years later, they exit with EBITDA of $40 at the same 10x multiple. Over the holding period, $70 of debt is fully paid down through free cash flow. We need to find MOIC and IRR on the sponsor's equity.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the initial investment. The purchase multiple is 10x EBITDA, so the enterprise value (EV) at acquisition is 10 * $24 = $240. \n\nThe financing is 2:1 debt-to-equity. That means for every $2 of debt, there's $1 of equity. So total capital is debt + equity = 2 parts debt + 1 part equity = 3 parts. Therefore, equity is 1/3 of the total EV. Wait, but EV is the total value, so the equity portion would be EV * (equity ratio). Since debt-to-equity is 2:1, debt is 2x equity, so total EV = debt + equity = 2E + E = 3E. Therefore, equity = EV / 3. So initial equity investment is $240 / 3 = $80.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. If debt-to-equity is 2:1, then debt = 2 * equity. So total EV = debt + equity = 2E + E = 3E. So equity is EV / 3. Yes, so $240 / 3 = $80. So the sponsor's initial equity investment is $80.\n\nNow, the exit value. Five years later, EBITDA is $40, same 10x multiple, so exit EV is 10 * $40 = $400.\n\nBut during the holding period, $70 of debt was paid down. Wait, the debt was initially part of the financing. Let's figure out the initial debt. Since debt is 2:1, debt = 2 * equity = 2 * $80 = $160. So initial debt is $160, equity is $80, total EV $240.\n\nOver five years, $70 of debt is paid down. So the remaining debt at exit is initial debt minus paid down debt: $160 - $70 = $90.\n\nBut the exit EV is $400. The exit value is the enterprise value, which is debt + equity. Wait, no. At exit, the enterprise value is $400, which is the value of the company before considering debt. So the equity value at exit would be exit EV minus remaining debt. So exit equity = $400 - $90 = $310.\n\nWait, let's make sure. Enterprise value at exit is $400. The company has some debt left. The sponsor's equity is the equity value, which is EV minus debt. So yes, exit equity = $400 - $90 = $310.\n\nSo the sponsor's equity investment was $80, and it's now worth $310. So MOIC is exit equity / initial equity = $310 / $80 = 3.875. So 3.88x, but maybe they want it as a decimal or fraction. The question says \"MOIC\", which is usually expressed as a multiple, so 3.875x, but perhaps rounded to two decimals, 3.88x. But let's check the calculation again.\n\nWait, initial equity: $80. Exit equity: $310. So 310 / 80 = 3.875. So 3.875x, which is 3.88x if rounded to two decimal places. But sometimes MOIC is presented as a decimal, so 3.875.\n\nNow for IRR. IRR is the internal rate of return. The sponsor invested $80 at time 0, and received $310 at time 5 years. So the cash flows are: -80 at t=0, +310 at t=5.\n\nTo calculate IRR, we need to find the rate r such that 80 = 310 / (1 + r)^5.\n\nSo (1 + r)^5 = 310 / 80 = 3.875.\n\nThen 1 + r = 3.875^(1/5).\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 3.875^(0.2). Let's approximate.\n\nWe know that 1.3^5 = 1.3*1.3=1.69, *1.3=2.197, *1.3=2.8561, *1.3=3.71293. That's close to 3.875.\n\n1.3^5 ≈ 3.71293.\n\n1.31^5: Let's compute 1.31^2 = 1.7161, 1.31^3 = 1.7161*1.31 ≈ 2.248091, 1.31^4 ≈ 2.248091*1.31 ≈ 2.944999, 1.31^5 ≈ 2.944999*1.31 ≈ 3.8579. That's very close to 3.875.\n\nSo 1.31^5 ≈ 3.8579, which is just a bit less than 3.875. So the rate is a bit more than 31%.\n\nLet's compute 3.875 / 3.8579 ≈ 1.0044. So the difference is about 0.44%. So maybe 31.1% or so.\n\nAlternatively, using logarithms. ln(3.875) ≈ 1.355. Divide by 5: 0.271. e^0.271 ≈ 1.311. So approximately 31.1% IRR.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects a more precise calculation. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nr = (3.875)^(1/5) - 1.\n\nCalculating 3.875^(0.2):\n\nTake natural log: ln(3.875) ≈ 1.355.\n\nDivide by 5: 0.271.\n\nExponentiate: e^0.271 ≈ 1.311.\n\nSo 31.1% IRR.\n\nBut let's check with a calculator. Let's say 1.31^5:\n\n1.31 * 1.31 = 1.7161\n\n1.7161 * 1.31 = 2.248091\n\n2.248091 * 1.31 = 2.94499921\n\n2.94499921 * 1.31 ≈ 3.857948965\n\nSo 1.31^5 ≈ 3.8579.\n\nWe need 3.875, so the difference is 3.875 - 3.8579 = 0.0171.\n\nSo how much more than 1.31?\n\nLet’s let x = 1.31 + Δ, and find Δ such that (1.31 + Δ)^5 = 3.875.\n\nApproximate using derivative. The derivative of f(x) = x^5 at x=1.31 is 5x^4. x^4 at 1.31 is (1.31^2)^2 = (1.7161)^2 ≈ 2.9449. So 5*2.9449 ≈ 14.7245.\n\nSo Δ ≈ (3.875 - 3.8579)/14.7245 ≈ 0.0171 / 14.7245 ≈ 0.00116.\n\nSo x ≈ 1.31 + 0.00116 ≈ 1.31116, so about 31.12% IRR.\n\nSo approximately 31.1%.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects us to use a financial calculator or a standard method. However, in many cases, for such problems, they might round to the nearest whole number or one decimal. So 31.1% or 31%.\n\nBut let's confirm the exit equity again. Initial debt was $160 (since 2:1 debt to equity, so debt = 2*80=160). Over five years, $70 of debt is paid down, so remaining debt is 160 -70=90. Exit EV is 10*40=400. So exit equity is 400 -90=310. Correct.\n\nInitial equity: 80. So MOIC is 310/80=3.875, which is 3.88x if rounded to two decimals, but often MOIC is presented as a decimal, so 3.875x. However, sometimes it's written as 3.88x. But the problem says \"concise, in the correct financial format\". MOIC is usually expressed as a multiple, so 3.88x or 3.875x. Let's check standard practice. For example, if it's exactly 3.875, it's often written as 3.88x. But maybe the problem expects 3.88.\n\nFor IRR, it's typically rounded to one decimal place, so 31.1% or 31%.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nInitial EV: 24*10=240.\n\nDebt-to-equity 2:1, so debt=160, equity=80. Correct.\n\nExit EV:40*10=400.\n\nDebt paid down:70, so remaining debt=160-70=90.\n\nExit equity=400-90=310. Correct.\n\nSo equity investment:80, exit equity:310. MOIC=310/80=3.875.\n\nIRR: 80*(1+r)^5=310 → (1+r)^5=3.875 → r≈31.1%.\n\nSo the answer should be MOIC of 3.88x and IRR of 31.1%.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"MOIC and IRR\". So need to present both.\n\nBut let me check if the debt paid down affects anything else. The problem states \"over the holding period, $70 of debt is fully paid down through free cash flow\". So the debt reduction is $70, so remaining debt is 160-70=90. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think: the sponsor's equity is the equity value at exit, which is EV minus debt. So yes, 400-90=310.\n\nSo MOIC is 310/80=3.875. So 3.88x.\n\nIRR is approximately 31.1%.\n\nBut let's see if the problem expects exact calculation. Maybe using the formula.\n\nAlternatively, using the rule of 72, but that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, using a calculator for IRR. If I have to compute it precisely, but since this is a text-based reasoning, the approximate 31.1% is acceptable.\n\nSo the final answer should be MOIC: 3.88x, IRR: 31.1%.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\". So probably MOIC as 3.88x and IRR as 31.1%.\n\nBut let's check if the MOIC is supposed to be a decimal or a multiple. MOIC is typically written as a multiple, like 3.88x. So 3.88x.\n\nIRR is a percentage, so 31.1%.\n\nBut let's confirm the calculation once more.\n\nInitial equity: $80.\n\nExit equity: $310.\n\nMOIC = 310 / 80 = 3.875. So 3.88 when rounded to two decimal places.\n\nIRR: 5 years, 3.875 multiple. As calculated, approximately 31.1%.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the answer should be MOIC of 3.88x and IRR of 31.1%.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"provide the final answer to the question in the required format\". The question asks for \"MOIC and IRR\", so need to present both.\n\nBut the instructions say \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\". So probably list both, separated by a comma or something.\n\nLooking at examples, sometimes it's written as MOIC: 3.88x, IRR: 31.1%.\n\nBut the problem says \"concise\", so maybe just the numbers with labels.\n\nBut the exact format isn't specified, but the example in the instructions says \"MOIC and IRR\", so likely need to state both.\n\nBut the user instruction says \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\".\n\nSo perhaps \"3.88x, 31.1%\" or \"MOIC: 3.88x, IRR: 31.1%\".\n\nBut to be safe, since it's a financial context, the standard way is to present MOIC as a multiple and IRR as a percentage.\n\nSo the answer should be MOIC of 3.88x and IRR of 31.1%.\n\nWait, but let's check if the debt paid down is $70, but does that affect the equity? No, because the debt is paid down from the company's cash flow, so the equity value is EV minus remaining debt. So yes, the calculation is correct.\n\nAnother check: total cash flow. The sponsor invested $80, got back $310 after 5 years. So yes, the IRR is based on that.\n\nSo I think the calculations are correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:3.88x, 31.1%",

      "question": "A business has a P/E ratio of 12 and reports $4 in EPS, making its stock trade at $48. If the tax rate is lowered from 40% to 28%, what is the updated stock price assuming the same P/E ratio?",
      "ground_truth": "$57.60",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about a business with a P/E ratio of 12 and $4 EPS, leading to a stock price of $48. The tax rate is going down from 40% to 28%, and we need to find the new stock price assuming the same P/E ratio.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what P/E ratio means. P/E stands for Price-to-Earnings ratio, which is calculated as the stock price divided by earnings per share (EPS). The problem states that the current P/E is 12, and EPS is $4, so 12 * 4 = $48, which matches the given stock price. That checks out.\n\nNow, the tax rate is changing from 40% to 28%. But wait, how does a tax rate affect the EPS? Taxes impact net income, which is used to calculate EPS. If the tax rate decreases, the company's net income would increase because they pay less in taxes. Higher net income means higher EPS, assuming the number of shares remains the same.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give us the current net income or the tax rate's effect on earnings. Hmm. Wait, maybe we need to assume that the tax rate change affects the earnings, but how much? Let me think.\n\nThe original tax rate is 40%, and it's lowered to 28%. The difference in tax rate is 12 percentage points. But to find the new EPS, we need to know how much the earnings before tax (EBT) are affected. However, the problem doesn't provide EBT or other financials. Maybe there's a standard way to approach this.\n\nWait, perhaps the key here is that the tax rate change affects the after-tax earnings, so the EPS would increase. But without knowing the pre-tax earnings, how can we calculate the new EPS?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simpler. The current EPS is $4, which is after tax. If the tax rate decreases, the after-tax earnings would be higher for the same pre-tax earnings. So, the new EPS would be higher than $4.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let’s denote:\n\nOriginal tax rate = 40%, so the company keeps 60% of pre-tax earnings (1 - 0.40 = 0.60).\n\nNew tax rate = 28%, so the company keeps 72% of pre-tax earnings (1 - 0.28 = 0.72).\n\nAssuming that the pre-tax earnings (EBT) remain the same, the new after-tax earnings would be higher. Therefore, the new EPS would be (original EPS / 0.60) * 0.72.\n\nWait, let's see. Original EPS = EBT * (1 - tax rate). So, EBT = EPS / (1 - tax rate).\n\nOriginal EBT = $4 / (1 - 0.40) = $4 / 0.60 ≈ $6.6667.\n\nNew EPS = EBT * (1 - new tax rate) = $6.6667 * (1 - 0.28) = $6.6667 * 0.72 ≈ $4.80.\n\nSo the new EPS would be $4.80.\n\nThen, with the same P/E ratio of 12, the new stock price would be P/E * new EPS = 12 * 4.80 = $57.60.\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again.\n\nOriginal EPS: $4, tax rate 40%, so EBT = 4 / 0.6 = 6.666...\n\nNew tax rate 28%, so new EPS = 6.666... * 0.72 = 4.8.\n\nThen, new price = 12 * 4.8 = 57.6.\n\nSo the updated stock price is $57.60.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no other factor. The problem states \"assuming the same P/E ratio,\" so we don't have to worry about the P/E changing. The key is that the tax rate change affects the EPS, which then affects the stock price via the P/E.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the tax rate decrease leads to a higher EPS. The percentage increase in EPS would be (0.72 / 0.60) = 1.2, so a 20% increase. So original EPS $4 * 1.2 = $4.80. Then 12 * 4.80 = 57.60.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the new stock price should be $57.60.\n</think>\n\nThe tax rate decrease from 40% to 28% increases after-tax earnings. Original EPS of $4 implies pre-tax earnings (EBT) of $4 / (1 - 0.40) = $6.6667. New EPS = $6.6667 × (1 - 0.28) = $4.80. With the same P/E ratio of 12, new stock price = 12 × $4.80 = $57.60.\n\n<answer>:57.60",

      "question": "Suppose a firm pays out a $15 dividend. How does this impact the firm's enterprise value (increase, decrease, or no change)?",
      "ground_truth": "No change",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about how a $15 dividend payment affects a firm's enterprise value. Hmm, I remember that enterprise value (EV) is calculated as the market capitalization plus debt minus cash. Dividends are paid out of cash, right? So when a company pays a dividend, it's reducing its cash reserves. \n\nWait, but enterprise value is supposed to represent the total value of the company, excluding cash because cash is a non-operating asset. So if the company pays out a dividend, it's taking cash out of the business. That would decrease the cash on the balance sheet, which in turn would lower the enterprise value. \n\nLet me double-check. Enterprise value = Equity Value + Debt - Cash. If the firm pays a dividend, cash decreases by $15. So EV would decrease by $15. But wait, does the dividend affect equity value? Dividends reduce equity because they're a distribution to shareholders, but enterprise value is calculated using market cap (which is equity value), so when dividends are paid, the stock price typically drops by the dividend amount, but enterprise value accounts for that by subtracting cash. \n\nWait, the key point is that dividends reduce cash, so EV = (Market Cap + Debt - Cash). If Cash decreases by $15, then EV decreases by $15. So the impact is a decrease. \n\nBut I should make sure there's no other factor. For example, if the dividend is paid from debt or something, but no, dividends are paid from cash. So yes, cash goes down, so EV goes down. \n\nAnother angle: Enterprise value is the value of the firm's operations, so paying a dividend doesn't change the underlying business value, but since EV subtracts cash, the reduction in cash directly lowers EV. So the answer should be decrease.\n</think>\n\nDividends paid reduce a firm's cash reserves. Enterprise value (EV) is calculated as Market Capitalization + Debt - Cash. A $15 dividend payment decreases cash by $15, directly reducing EV by the same amount. Thus, EV decreases.\n\n<answer>:decrease",

      "question": "A firm trading at a 20x P/E acquires a target at 10x P/E using 50% new shares and 50% debt. What interest rate on the borrowed funds would keep the deal neutral to earnings per share?",
      "ground_truth": "15%",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this financial question. So, the problem is about a firm that's trading at a 20x P/E ratio acquiring a target at 10x P/E using 50% new shares and 50% debt. We need to find the interest rate on the borrowed funds that would keep the deal neutral to earnings per share (EPS).\n\nFirst, I need to recall how EPS is affected by acquisitions. When a company acquires another, the EPS can be diluted or accretive depending on the P/E ratios and the financing structure. The key here is that the deal is neutral to EPS, meaning the combined EPS after the acquisition should be the same as before.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's assume the acquiring firm has earnings E and shares S, so its EPS is E/S. The target has earnings E_target and shares S_target. But since we're dealing with P/E ratios, maybe it's better to use the P/E to find the earnings relative to the market value.\n\nThe acquiring firm's P/E is 20x, so its market cap is 20 * E. The target's P/E is 10x, so its market cap is 10 * E_target. Wait, but the target is being acquired at 10x P/E, so the purchase price would be 10 times the target's earnings.\n\nThe acquisition is financed with 50% new shares and 50% debt. So, half the purchase price is paid with new shares, and half with debt. The debt will have an interest expense, which will reduce the combined earnings.\n\nFor the deal to be EPS neutral, the incremental earnings from the target (after accounting for the interest on debt) should equal the dilution from the new shares.\n\nLet me set up some variables. Let's say the target's earnings are E_target. The purchase price is 10 * E_target (since it's acquired at 10x P/E). Half of that is debt, so debt amount is (10 * E_target)/2 = 5 * E_target. The other half is new shares, so the number of new shares issued would be based on the acquiring firm's share price.\n\nWait, the acquiring firm's share price can be derived from its P/E. If the acquiring firm's P/E is 20x, and its earnings are E, then its market cap is 20E, so share price is (20E)/S, where S is the number of shares. But maybe it's simpler to assume that the share price is such that the new shares issued are proportional.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the concept of earnings per share accretion/dilution. The formula for EPS neutrality in an acquisition is:\n\n(Combined Earnings) / (Combined Shares) = Original EPS\n\nOriginal EPS = E / S\n\nCombined Earnings = E + E_target - Interest Expense\n\nCombined Shares = S + (New Shares Issued)\n\nThe new shares issued would be (50% of purchase price) / (acquiring firm's share price). The purchase price is 10 * E_target (since target is at 10x P/E), so 50% of that is 5 * E_target. The share price of the acquiring firm is (Market Cap) / S = (20 * E) / S. So, the number of new shares issued is (5 * E_target) / (20E / S) = (5 E_target S) / (20 E) = (E_target S) / (4 E).\n\nThe interest expense is debt * interest rate. Debt is 5 * E_target, so interest expense = 5 * E_target * r, where r is the interest rate.\n\nFor EPS neutrality:\n\n(E + E_target - 5 E_target r) / (S + (E_target S)/(4 E)) = E / S\n\nLet's simplify this equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by the denominator:\n\nE + E_target - 5 E_target r = (E / S) * (S + (E_target S)/(4 E))\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n(E / S) * S + (E / S) * (E_target S)/(4 E) = E + (E_target)/4\n\nSo:\n\nE + E_target - 5 E_target r = E + E_target / 4\n\nSubtract E from both sides:\n\nE_target - 5 E_target r = E_target / 4\n\nDivide both sides by E_target (assuming E_target ≠ 0):\n\n1 - 5r = 1/4\n\nThen:\n\n5r = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nr = (3/4)/5 = 3/20 = 0.15 or 15%\n\nWait, so the interest rate should be 15%? Let me check that again.\n\nStarting from:\n\nE + E_target - 5 E_target r = E + E_target / 4\n\nSubtract E from both sides:\n\nE_target - 5 E_target r = E_target / 4\n\nDivide both sides by E_target:\n\n1 - 5r = 1/4\n\nSo 5r = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nr = 3/(4*5) = 3/20 = 0.15, so 15%.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me verify with an example.\n\nSuppose the acquiring firm has earnings of $100 million, so with a 20x P/E, market cap is $2 billion. Let's say it has 10 million shares, so share price is $200 per share (2 billion / 10 million).\n\nTarget has earnings of $10 million (so 10x P/E, market cap is $100 million). Purchase price is $100 million. 50% debt, so $50 million debt, 50% new shares, so $50 million in new shares. The new shares issued would be $50 million / $200 per share = 250,000 shares.\n\nInterest expense on $50 million debt: 50 million * r.\n\nCombined earnings: 100 + 10 - 50r = 110 - 50r\n\nCombined shares: 10 million + 0.25 million = 10.25 million\n\nOriginal EPS: 100 / 10 = $10 per share\n\nNew EPS: (110 - 50r) / 10.25\n\nSet equal to $10:\n\n(110 - 50r) / 10.25 = 10\n\n110 - 50r = 102.5\n\n50r = 110 - 102.5 = 7.5\n\nr = 7.5 / 50 = 0.15 or 15%\n\nYes, that checks out. So the interest rate needed is 15%.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the interest rate on borrowed funds that keeps the acquisition neutral to earnings per share (EPS), we analyze the impact of financing (50% debt, 50% new shares) on combined earnings and shares.\n\nLet:\n- Acquirer's P/E = 20x, Target's P/E = 10x.\n- Target's earnings = $E_T$, so acquisition price = $10E_T$.\n- Debt = $5E_T$, New shares = $5E_T$ (value at acquirer's share price).\n\nAcquirer's share price = $ \\frac{20 \\times \\text{Acquirer's Earnings}}{\\text{Acquirer's Shares}} $.  \nNew shares issued = $ \\frac{5E_T}{\\text{Share Price}} $.\n\nFor EPS neutrality:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Acquirer Earnings} + E_T - \\text{Interest}}{\\text{Acquirer Shares} + \\text{New Shares}} = \\frac{\\text{Acquirer Earnings}}{\\text{Acquirer Shares}}\n$$\n\nSimplifying leads to:\n$$\n1 - 5r = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies r = \\frac{3}{20} = 15\\%\n$$\n\n<answer>:15%",

      "question": "If a business is trading at 15x its earnings and acquires a target valued at 7x earnings, does this transaction increase or decrease the acquirer's earnings per share?",
      "ground_truth": "Unknown unless deal is 100%, where deal would be accretive",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this financial question. So, the problem is: If a business is trading at 15x its earnings and acquires a target valued at 7x earnings, does this transaction increase or decrease the acquirer's earnings per share?\n\nHmm, first, I need to recall how earnings per share (EPS) works in acquisitions. EPS is calculated as net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. When a company acquires another, the combined net income and the number of shares might change, which affects EPS.\n\nThe key here is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The acquirer is trading at 15x earnings, meaning for every dollar of earnings, the market values the company at $15. The target is valued at 7x earnings, so it's cheaper relative to its earnings.\n\nWait, but how does the P/E ratio of the target compared to the acquirer affect EPS? I remember that if the acquirer pays more than the target's earnings multiple, it might dilute EPS. Wait, no, let's think carefully.\n\nSuppose the acquirer has a P/E of 15, so if it's buying a target with a lower P/E (7x), that means the target is cheaper in terms of earnings. So, the acquirer is paying less per dollar of earnings for the target than it's currently valued at. That should be accretive to EPS.\n\nLet me think with an example. Let's say the acquirer has earnings of $100 million, so its market cap is 15 * 100 = $1.5 billion. The target has earnings of $10 million, so its market cap is 7 * 10 = $70 million. If the acquirer buys the target for $70 million, which is 7x the target's earnings.\n\nNow, the combined earnings would be $100M + $10M = $110M. The acquirer's original shares are, say, 10 million (since market cap is $1.5B, and P/E is 15, so EPS is $10, so 1.5B / 10 = 150 million shares? Wait, maybe better to use per share.\n\nWait, maybe better to use hypothetical numbers. Let's assume the acquirer has earnings per share (EPS) of $1, so with a 15x P/E, the stock price is $15. The target has an EPS of $1 as well, but with a 7x P/E, so its stock price is $7. But when acquiring, the acquirer might pay a premium, but the question says the target is valued at 7x earnings, so perhaps the acquisition is priced at 7x the target's earnings.\n\nWait, the target's earnings are being acquired at 7x, so the price paid for the target is 7 times its earnings. The acquirer's own earnings are valued at 15x. So, the acquirer is paying a lower multiple (7x) than its own multiple (15x) for the target's earnings. That means the target's earnings are cheaper, so acquiring them should increase the combined EPS.\n\nLet me do the math. Suppose the acquirer has Earnings = E, Shares = S, so EPS = E/S. The target has Earnings = e, and the acquirer pays 7e for it. The target's earnings are e, so the cost is 7e. The acquirer's new earnings will be E + e, and the new shares will be S + (7e / P), but wait, how is the acquisition financed? The question doesn't specify if it's cash or stock. Oh, this is a problem. The question doesn't say whether the acquisition is cash or stock-based.\n\nWait, in most cases, when talking about EPS impact, if it's a stock-for-stock acquisition, the number of shares increases. If it's cash, then shares remain the same. But the question doesn't specify. Hmm. But in the context of P/E ratios, usually, when comparing multiples, the assumption is that the acquisition is done via stock, because if it's cash, the EPS impact would depend on the cost, but the question states the target is valued at 7x earnings, which is a market valuation, so likely the acquisition is priced at that multiple, and assuming it's a stock deal.\n\nWait, but the standard way to determine if an acquisition is accretive or dilutive is to compare the acquirer's P/E to the target's P/E. If the acquirer's P/E is higher than the target's P/E, then acquiring the target (which has a lower P/E) will be accretive. Because the acquirer is paying less per dollar of earnings than it's currently valued at.\n\nSo, acquirer P/E = 15, target P/E = 7. Since 15 > 7, the acquisition is accretive. Therefore, EPS increases.\n\nWait, let's confirm. If the acquirer has a higher P/E, it means it's paying more for its own earnings. So when it buys a company with a lower P/E (cheaper earnings), the combined EPS should go up. For example, if you have a company worth 15x earnings and you buy a company worth 7x earnings, you're getting more earnings for less money, so your overall earnings per share should increase.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should be that the transaction increases the acquirer's EPS.\n</think>\n\nThe acquirer trades at a higher P/E ratio (15x) than the target (7x). When acquiring a target with a lower P/E ratio, the transaction is accretive to EPS because the acquirer pays less per dollar of earnings than its own valuation. This increases the combined earnings per share.\n\n<answer>:increase",

      "question": "Imagine a firm valued at 600M, with 400M in senior secured notes and an additional 300M in junior secured notes. How would each note class be priced based on this valuation?",
      "ground_truth": "First lien trades at 100c, second lien trades at 66.7c",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the firm is valued at 600 million. They have 400 million in senior secured notes and an additional 300 million in junior secured notes. The question is asking how each note class would be priced based on this valuation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how secured debt works in terms of priority. Senior secured notes usually have first claim on the assets, right? So if the firm is valued at 600 million, the senior secured notes should be covered first. The senior notes are 400 million, which is less than the 600 million valuation. So the senior notes should be fully covered, meaning they'd be priced at par or maybe even at a discount if there's some risk, but the question seems to be about the theoretical pricing based on the asset value.\n\nWait, but the total debt is 400M (senior) + 300M (junior) = 700M. The firm's value is 600M. So the total debt exceeds the firm's value by 100M. But since senior debt has priority, the senior notes would be paid first from the 600M. So the 400M senior notes would be fully covered, meaning they'd be priced at 100% of face value. The junior notes are subordinated, so they'd only get paid after senior is covered. But since the total value is 600M, and senior takes 400M, the remaining 200M would go to junior. But the junior is 300M, so they'd only get 200M back, which is about 66.67% of their face value.\n\nWait, but the question is about how they'd be priced. Pricing usually refers to the market price, but in this context, maybe it's about the recovery rate. So senior secured notes would have a recovery rate of 100% (since 400M <= 600M), and junior would have a recovery rate of (600M - 400M)/300M = 200/300 = 66.67%.\n\nBut the question says \"how would each note class be priced\". In finance, when a company is liquidated, the recovery rates for different debt classes are based on the asset value. So senior secured would be fully paid, so priced at par (100%), and junior would be priced at 66.67% of face value.\n\nWait, but the firm's value is 600M. Senior secured is 400M, so they get all 400M. Then junior is 300M, but only 200M left, so 200/300 = 66.67%. So the pricing would be senior at 100%, junior at 66.67%.\n\nBut the question might be expecting the answer in terms of percentage of face value. So senior notes would be priced at 100% (since they're fully secured), and junior at 66.67%.\n\nWait, but sometimes in such problems, if the asset value is less than the senior debt, the senior would be discounted, but here asset value (600) is more than senior (400), so senior is fully covered. So senior is 100%, junior is (600-400)/300 = 66.67%.\n\nSo the answer should be senior secured notes priced at 100% and junior secured notes at 66.67% of face value.\n\nBut the question says \"how would each note class be priced based on this valuation?\" So the pricing would reflect the recovery rates. So senior: 100%, junior: 66.67%.\n\nI think that's it. Let me check again. Total assets 600M. Senior debt 400M. So after paying senior, 200M left. Junior debt 300M, so they get 200M, which is 200/300 = 66.666...%, so 66.67%.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final answer should state the percentages.\n</think>\n\nThe firm's valuation of $600M is insufficient to cover the total debt of $700M ($400M senior + $300M junior). Senior secured notes have first claim on assets, so they are fully covered ($400M ≤ $600M), resulting in a 100% recovery rate. Junior secured notes are subordinated and receive the remaining $200M ($600M - $400M), leading to a recovery rate of $200M / $300M = 66.67%.\n\n<answer>:Senior: 100%, Junior: 66.67%",

      "question": "A business earns $200 in sales per period, with a 25% gross margin. Which option boosts profit most: increasing unit sales by 16%, raising prices by 4%, or cutting overhead by $2?",
      "ground_truth": "Price and volume",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the business earns $200 in sales per period with a 25% gross margin. I need to figure out which option—increasing unit sales by 16%, raising prices by 4%, or cutting overhead by $2—boosts profit the most.\n\nFirst, I should recall what gross margin means. Gross margin is the percentage of sales revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold (COGS). So, a 25% gross margin means that for every dollar of sales, 25 cents is gross profit, and 75 cents is COGS. Wait, actually, gross margin is calculated as (Sales - COGS)/Sales. So, if gross margin is 25%, then COGS is 75% of sales.\n\nGiven that sales are $200 per period, let's calculate the current gross profit. Gross profit = Sales × Gross Margin = 200 × 25% = $50. So, COGS is 200 - 50 = $150. But wait, maybe I should confirm that. If gross margin is 25%, then gross profit is 25% of sales, so yes, 200 * 0.25 = $50. So, current gross profit is $50.\n\nNow, the question is about profit. But wait, profit usually refers to net profit, which is gross profit minus operating expenses (overhead). However, the problem mentions \"cutting overhead by $2,\" so overhead is part of the operating expenses. But the problem doesn't specify the current overhead amount. Hmm, this might be a problem. Wait, maybe the question is simplifying and considering gross profit as the profit before overhead, and then overhead is a separate expense. But since the problem states \"boosts profit,\" and overhead is a cost, cutting overhead by $2 would directly increase net profit by $2, assuming all else is equal.\n\nBut let's check each option.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the current profit. Let's assume that the current profit is gross profit minus overhead. But since the problem doesn't give the current overhead, maybe we need to assume that the current profit is gross profit (if overhead is zero), but that seems unlikely. Wait, but the problem says \"cutting overhead by $2,\" so overhead must be a cost that's subtracted from gross profit to get net profit. However, without knowing the current overhead, how can we calculate the impact of cutting it by $2? Wait, but the question is about the change in profit, not the absolute profit. So, cutting overhead by $2 would increase profit by $2, regardless of the current overhead level. Because profit = gross profit - overhead. So, if overhead decreases by $2, profit increases by $2. So that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the other options: increasing unit sales by 16% or raising prices by 4%.\n\nLet's handle each option.\n\nOption 1: Increasing unit sales by 16%.\n\nCurrent sales are $200. If unit sales increase by 16%, assuming that the price per unit remains the same, then new sales would be 200 * 1.16 = $232.\n\nGross margin is 25%, so new gross profit would be 232 * 25% = $58. So, the increase in gross profit is 58 - 50 = $8. But wait, does increasing unit sales affect COGS? Since gross margin is 25%, COGS is 75% of sales. So, if sales increase to $232, COGS would be 232 * 0.75 = $174. So, gross profit is 232 - 174 = $58, which matches. So, the gross profit increases by $8. But does this affect overhead? The problem doesn't mention any change in overhead, so we can assume overhead remains the same. Therefore, the increase in profit would be $8.\n\nOption 2: Raising prices by 4%.\n\nCurrent sales are $200. If prices are raised by 4%, assuming the same number of units sold, the new sales would be 200 * 1.04 = $208.\n\nGross margin is still 25%, so new gross profit would be 208 * 25% = $52. So, the increase in gross profit is 52 - 50 = $2. Wait, but is that correct? Wait, if prices are raised by 4%, but the cost structure remains the same, then the gross margin might change. Wait, the problem states that the business has a 25% gross margin. If they raise prices by 4%, but the COGS remains the same (assuming they don't change the cost of goods), then the gross margin would increase. Wait, but the problem says \"raising prices by 4%\", so perhaps the sales revenue increases by 4%, but the COGS remains the same. Wait, but gross margin is calculated as (Sales - COGS)/Sales. So, if sales increase by 4% but COGS stays the same, then the gross margin would increase, but the problem states that the current gross margin is 25%. However, the question is about the effect of raising prices, so maybe we need to assume that the COGS remains the same, so the new gross profit would be (Sales * 1.04) - COGS.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Current sales: $200. Current COGS: since gross margin is 25%, COGS = 200 * (1 - 0.25) = 200 * 0.75 = $150.\n\nIf prices are raised by 4%, assuming the same number of units sold, sales become 200 * 1.04 = $208. COGS remains $150 (since it's based on the cost of goods, not sales). So, new gross profit = 208 - 150 = $58. So, the increase in gross profit is 58 - 50 = $8. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. So, if COGS is fixed (assuming that the cost per unit doesn't change, so total COGS is the same as before), then raising prices by 4% would increase sales revenue by 4%, but COGS stays the same, so gross profit increases by the 4% of sales, which is 200 * 0.04 = $8. So, gross profit increases by $8.\n\nWait, but why did I think earlier that gross margin would change? Because if COGS is fixed, then the gross margin would increase. But the problem states that the current gross margin is 25%, but when we raise prices, the gross margin would be higher. However, the question is about the profit boost, so regardless of the margin, the actual dollar amount of profit increase is what matters.\n\nSo, for price increase: new sales = 208, COGS = 150, gross profit = 58, so +$8.\n\nFor sales increase: new sales = 232, COGS = 232 * 0.75 = 174 (since COGS is 75% of sales), so gross profit = 232 - 174 = 58, so also +$8.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Both options give the same increase in gross profit? Let me check that again.\n\nFor increasing unit sales by 16%: assuming that the cost structure remains the same, so COGS is 75% of new sales. So, new sales = 200 * 1.16 = 232. COGS = 232 * 0.75 = 174. Gross profit = 232 - 174 = 58. Current gross profit was 50, so increase of 8.\n\nFor raising prices by 4%: new sales = 200 * 1.04 = 208. COGS is still 150 (since it's based on the cost of goods sold, which is fixed if the number of units sold is the same). Wait, but if they raise prices, do they sell the same number of units? The problem says \"raising prices by 4%\", so assuming quantity sold remains constant. So, COGS would be the same as before, because they're selling the same number of units, each with the same cost. So, COGS = 150. Therefore, new gross profit = 208 - 150 = 58. So, increase of 8.\n\nSo both options give an $8 increase in gross profit. Then, the third option is cutting overhead by $2, which would increase profit by $2.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"boosts profit most\". So, if two options give $8 and one gives $2, then the first two options are better. But the question is phrased as \"which option\", implying one answer. So, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's double-check the price increase. If the price is raised by 4%, but the gross margin is 25%, does that mean that the cost is fixed? Let's think in terms of cost per unit.\n\nSuppose current sales: $200. Let's say they sell 100 units at $2 each. So, price per unit is $2. Gross margin is 25%, so COGS per unit is $2 * (1 - 0.25) = $1.50. So, total COGS for 100 units is $150, which matches.\n\nIf they raise prices by 4%, new price per unit is $2 * 1.04 = $2.08. If they sell the same number of units (100), new sales = 100 * 2.08 = $208. COGS remains $1.50 per unit, so total COGS = 100 * 1.50 = $150. Gross profit = 208 - 150 = $58. So, increase of $8.\n\nIf they increase unit sales by 16%, so new quantity is 116 units. Assuming price per unit remains $2, new sales = 116 * 2 = $232. COGS per unit is $1.50, so total COGS = 116 * 1.50 = $174. Gross profit = 232 - 174 = $58. So, also an increase of $8.\n\nSo both options give the same $8 increase in gross profit. Then, cutting overhead by $2 gives a $2 increase. So, the first two options are better. But the question asks \"which option boosts profit most\", and if two options are equal, but the problem probably expects one answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that for the sales increase, COGS is 75% of sales. But in reality, if they sell more units, COGS would increase proportionally, which is what I did. So, yes, COGS is 75% of sales, so when sales increase by 16%, COGS increases by 16%, so gross profit increases by 16% of sales? Wait, no. Let's see: current gross profit is 25% of sales. If sales increase by 16%, and gross margin remains the same (25%), then gross profit increases by 16% of sales. So, 200 * 0.16 * 0.25? Wait, no. Wait, gross profit is 25% of sales. So, if sales increase by 16%, new gross profit is 25% of (200 * 1.16) = 25% * 232 = 58. So, the increase is 58 - 50 = 8. Which is 200 * 0.16 * 0.25? Wait, 200 * 0.16 = 32, 32 * 0.25 = 8. Yes, that's correct. So, the increase in gross profit is 16% of sales times gross margin percentage. So, 200 * 0.16 * 0.25 = 8.\n\nFor the price increase: if price increases by 4%, and quantity remains the same, then sales increase by 4%, so the increase in gross profit is 4% of sales times gross margin? Wait, no. Because COGS is fixed. Wait, in the price increase scenario, COGS is fixed (since quantity sold is the same), so the increase in sales revenue directly translates to increase in gross profit. So, 4% of 200 is $8, so gross profit increases by $8.\n\nSo both options give $8 increase. But the problem lists them as separate options. However, the problem might have a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"cutting overhead by $2\". Overhead is part of operating expenses, so if overhead is cut by $2, profit increases by $2. So, the two options that increase gross profit by $8 each would be better than cutting overhead by $2.\n\nBut the question is asking \"which option boosts profit most\", so if two options are equal, but the problem probably expects us to choose between them. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the price increase calculation.\n\nWait, another way: if the gross margin is 25%, then the markup is 33.33% (since 25% margin means cost is 75%, so markup is 25/75 = 33.33%). But when you raise prices, if the cost remains the same, the margin increases. However, the problem states that the current gross margin is 25%, but when you raise prices, the new gross margin would be higher. But the question is about the profit increase, not the margin. So, regardless of the margin, the dollar amount of profit increase is what matters.\n\nSo, for price increase: sales go up by 4% (to $208), COGS stays at $150, so profit increases by $8.\n\nFor sales increase: sales go up by 16% (to $232), COGS goes up to $174 (75% of 232), so profit increases by $8.\n\nSo both give $8. Then, cutting overhead by $2 gives $2. So, the first two options are better. But the problem asks \"which option\", implying one. Maybe the problem expects that increasing sales by 16% is better, but according to the math, they are equal.\n\nWait, but let's check the numbers again.\n\nCurrent profit: let's assume that overhead is, say, X. So current profit = gross profit - overhead = 50 - X.\n\nAfter increasing sales by 16%: new gross profit = 58, so new profit = 58 - X. Increase in profit: 8.\n\nAfter raising prices by 4%: new gross profit = 58, so new profit = 58 - X. Increase in profit: 8.\n\nAfter cutting overhead by $2: new profit = 50 - (X - 2) = 50 - X + 2 = (50 - X) + 2. So increase is $2.\n\nSo both the first two options give an $8 increase, which is more than $2. So, the answer should be either increasing unit sales by 16% or raising prices by 4%, but since the problem lists them as separate options, and they are equal, but the problem might have intended one of them. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the price increase.\n\nWait, another angle: when they say \"raising prices by 4%\", does that mean the price per unit increases by 4%, but the quantity sold might decrease? But the problem doesn't mention any change in quantity sold, so we assume quantity remains the same. So, sales revenue increases by 4%, leading to higher gross profit.\n\nBut in the sales increase option, increasing unit sales by 16% (assuming price per unit stays the same), so sales revenue increases by 16%, leading to higher gross profit.\n\nBut since gross margin is 25%, the increase in gross profit for a sales increase is 25% of the sales increase. So, 16% of 200 is 32, 25% of 32 is 8. For price increase, the sales increase is 4% of 200 = 8, and since COGS is fixed, the gross profit increase is 8. So both are 8.\n\nHmm. So both options give the same profit boost. But the problem asks \"which option\", so maybe there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem considers that when you increase unit sales, you might have additional overhead costs, but the problem doesn't mention that. It says \"cutting overhead by $2\", implying that overhead is a separate cost, but for the other options, we assume no additional overhead. So, the problem probably assumes that increasing sales or raising prices doesn't affect overhead, so the profit increase is solely from gross profit.\n\nGiven that, both options give $8, and cutting overhead gives $2. So, the answer should be either of the first two. But the problem lists them as separate options, so perhaps the intended answer is increasing unit sales by 16%, but according to the math, they are equal.\n\nWait, but let's check the problem statement again: \"increasing unit sales by 16%\", \"raising prices by 4%\", \"cutting overhead by $2\".\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the price increase. Let's do it with actual numbers.\n\nCurrent sales: $200.\n\nGross margin 25%, so COGS = 200 * 0.75 = $150.\n\nGross profit = $50.\n\nOption 1: Increase unit sales by 16%. Assuming that the price per unit remains the same, so new sales = 200 * 1.16 = $232.\n\nCOGS = 232 * 0.75 = $174.\n\nGross profit = 232 - 174 = $58. Increase of $8.\n\nOption 2: Raise prices by 4%. Assuming quantity sold remains the same, so new sales = 200 * 1.04 = $208.\n\nCOGS remains $150 (since same quantity sold, same cost per unit).\n\nGross profit = 208 - 150 = $58. Increase of $8.\n\nOption 3: Cut overhead by $2. Assuming overhead is a fixed cost, so profit increases by $2.\n\nSo, both options 1 and 2 give $8 increase, option 3 gives $2. So, the answer should be either option 1 or 2. But the problem asks \"which option\", so maybe the intended answer is increasing unit sales by 16%, but according to the math, they are equal. However, in some contexts, increasing sales volume might be considered better, but the problem is purely about the dollar amount.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem expects that when you raise prices, the gross margin increases, but the question is about profit, not margin. So, the dollar amount is the same.\n\nGiven that, the problem might have a typo, but since both options give the same result, but the problem lists them as separate, perhaps the intended answer is increasing unit sales by 16%, but I need to check if there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, another way: maybe for the price increase, the 4% is on the price, but the gross margin is based on the new price. Wait, no, the gross margin is a percentage of sales, so regardless of price, the gross profit is sales minus COGS. If COGS is fixed, then price increase leads to higher gross profit.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem assumes that the gross margin remains 25% after the price increase, which would mean that COGS adjusts, but that's not how it works. Gross margin is a result of sales and COGS, not a target. So, if you raise prices without changing COGS, the gross margin increases.\n\nBut the problem states the current gross margin is 25%, so when we calculate the effect of price increase, we should use the current COGS.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Both options give $8.\n\nBut the problem might have intended that raising prices by 4% leads to a different result. Let's see: if the gross margin is 25%, then the cost is 75% of sales. So, if you raise prices by 4%, the new sales are 208, but the cost would still be 75% of the original sales? No, that doesn't make sense. Cost is based on the cost of goods, not sales. So, if you sell the same number of units, the cost remains the same.\n\nFor example, if originally, selling 100 units at $2 each, cost per unit $1.50, total cost $150.\n\nAfter price increase, selling 100 units at $2.08 each, cost per unit still $1.50, total cost $150. So, gross profit is 208 - 150 = 58.\n\nFor sales increase, selling 116 units at $2 each, cost per unit $1.50, total cost 116*1.50=174, sales 232, gross profit 58.\n\nSo, both are correct.\n\nGiven that, the answer should be that both increasing unit sales by 16% and raising prices by 4% boost profit by $8, which is more than cutting overhead by $2. But since the question asks for \"which option\", and they are equal, but the problem might expect us to choose one. However, in the context of the problem, maybe the intended answer is increasing unit sales by 16%, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but let's check the numbers again. Maybe I made a mistake in the price increase.\n\nIf the price is raised by 4%, and the gross margin is 25%, does that mean that the new gross margin is higher? But the question is about the profit increase, not the margin. So, regardless of the margin, the dollar amount is what's important.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that when you raise prices, the gross margin remains 25%, so the COGS would increase proportionally. But that's not how it works. If you raise prices, COGS doesn't automatically increase; it's based on the cost of the goods sold.\n\nFor example, if you sell a product for $2 with a cost of $1.50 (25% margin), and you raise the price to $2.08, the cost is still $1.50 per unit, so the new margin is (2.08 - 1.50)/2.08 = 0.58/2.08 ≈ 27.88%, but the gross profit per unit is $0.58, so total gross profit is 100 * 0.58 = $58, which matches.\n\nSo, the calculation is correct.\n\nGiven that, both options give the same profit boost. But since the problem lists them as separate options, and the answer format requires a single answer, perhaps the intended answer is increasing unit sales by 16%, but I'm not sure. However, in some textbooks, increasing sales volume might be considered more beneficial, but mathematically, they are equal.\n\nWait, but let's see the exact numbers:\n\n- Increasing sales by 16%: profit increase $8.\n\n- Raising prices by 4%: profit increase $8.\n\n- Cutting overhead by $2: profit increase $2.\n\nSo, the first two options are equal. But the problem might have a mistake, or perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, another possibility: when they say \"increasing unit sales by 16%\", does that mean that the number of units sold increases by 16%, but the price per unit remains the same, so sales revenue increases by 16%, leading to a gross profit increase of 16% of sales * gross margin. Wait, no, gross profit is 25% of sales, so a 16% increase in sales leads to a 16% increase in gross profit. So, 200 * 0.16 * 0.25 = 8. Correct.\n\nFor price increase: 4% increase in price, same quantity, so sales increase by 4%, and since COGS is fixed, gross profit increases by 4% of sales, which is 200 * 0.04 = 8. Correct.\n\nSo, both are 8.\n\nGiven that, the answer should be that both options 1 and 2 are better, but since the problem asks for \"which option\", and they are equal, but the problem might expect us to list both. However, the answer format requires a concise answer in financial format.\n\nWait, the problem says \"provide the final answer in the required format\", which is a single answer. So, perhaps the intended answer is increasing unit sales by 16%, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the price increase calculation.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose the gross margin is 25%, so the cost is 75% of sales. If you raise prices by 4%, the new sales are 208, but the cost would still be 75% of the original sales? No, that's not right. Cost is based on the cost of goods, not sales. So, cost should remain the same if quantity sold is the same.\n\nFor example, if you sell 100 units, cost per unit is $1.50, total cost $150. If you raise price to $2.08, you still sell 100 units, cost is still $150. So, gross profit is 208 - 150 = 58.\n\nIf you increase sales to 116 units at $2 each, cost is 116 * 1.50 = 174, sales 232, gross profit 58.\n\nSo, both are correct.\n\nGiven that, the answer should be that increasing unit sales by 16% and raising prices by 4% both boost profit by $8, which is more than cutting overhead by $2. But since the question asks for \"which option\", and they are equal, but the problem might expect us to choose one. However, in the absence of further information, I think the intended answer is increasing unit sales by 16%, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but let's check the numbers again. Maybe the problem considers that when you raise prices, the gross margin increases, but the question is about profit, so it's still the dollar amount. So, both are equal.\n\nBut the problem might have a typo, and the intended numbers would make one option better. For example, if the price increase was 5% instead of 4%, but as given, it's 4%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that for the price increase, the gross margin remains 25%, so COGS increases. Let's see what happens then.\n\nIf gross margin remains 25%, then COGS = 75% of new sales.\n\nFor price increase: new sales = 200 * 1.04 = 208.\n\nCOGS = 208 * 0.75 = 156.\n\nGross profit = 208 - 156 = 52.\n\nIncrease in gross profit = 52 - 50 = $2.\n\nBut that would mean that the gross margin is maintained, which would require that COGS increases, but that's not how price increases work. If you raise prices, COGS doesn't automatically increase; it's the cost to produce the goods, which is fixed. So, this approach is incorrect.\n\nThe problem states that the business has a 25% gross margin, which is a current state. When they raise prices, the gross margin would increase, but the COGS remains the same. So, the correct calculation is that COGS is fixed, leading to a higher gross profit.\n\nTherefore, the initial calculation is correct: both options give $8 increase.\n\nGiven that, and since the problem asks for \"which option\", and they are equal, but the answer format requires a single answer, I think the problem expects us to recognize that both are equal, but since it's a multiple-choice style question, perhaps the intended answer is increasing unit sales by 16%, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but let's see the options again. The problem lists three options: increasing sales by 16%, raising prices by 4%, cutting overhead by $2.\n\nIf both first two options give the same result, but the problem might have a mistake. However, in the context of the problem, perhaps the intended answer is increasing unit sales by 16%, as it's a common strategy.\n\nBut according to the math, they are equal. So, the answer should be that both options 1 and 2 are better, but since the format requires a single answer, maybe the problem expects us to choose one. However, in the absence of further information, I'll go with the calculation.\n\nWait, but let's see: the problem says \"boosts profit most\". If two options are equal, then technically, both are the best. But since the answer format is a single line, perhaps the problem expects us to state that both are equal, but the instructions say \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\".\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem had a typo, and the intended numbers were different. For example, if the price increase was 5%, then it would be 10, but as given, it's 4%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sales increase calculation. Let's verify with another example.\n\nSuppose sales are $200, gross margin 25%, so COGS $150, gross profit $50.\n\nOption 1: Increase sales by 16% to $232. COGS = 232 * 0.75 = $174. Gross profit = 232 - 174 = $58. Profit increase: $8.\n\nOption 2: Increase price by 4% to $208. COGS remains $150. Gross profit = 208 - 150 = $58. Profit increase: $8.\n\nYes, both are $8.\n\nSo, the answer should be that increasing unit sales by 16% and raising prices by 4% both boost profit by $8, which is more than cutting overhead by $2. But since the question asks for \"which option\", and they are equal, but the problem might expect us to list both. However, the answer format requires a single answer.\n\nWait, the problem might have a mistake, but given the options, the correct answer is that both options 1 and 2 are better, but since we have to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is increasing unit sales by 16%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers that cutting overhead is a fixed $2, while the others are percentage-based, but no, the calculations show otherwise.\n\nGiven that, I think the problem expects us to recognize that both options 1 and 2 are equal, but since it's a multiple-choice question, and the options are listed separately, perhaps the intended answer is increasing unit sales by 16%, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but let's check the numbers once more. If the business increases sales by 16%, they get an $8 increase. If they raise prices by 4%, they also get $8. So, they are equal.",

      "ground_truth": "Option Y",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, we have two investment opportunities, both with a 22% levered IRR. Option X is financed at 4x leverage, and Option Y at 7x leverage. Both require the same equity investment. The question is which has greater financial risk.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what leverage means here. Leverage ratio usually refers to the debt-to-equity ratio. So, 4x leverage means that for every $1 of equity, there's $4 of debt. Similarly, 7x would be $7 debt per $1 equity.\n\nWait, but the problem says both require the same equity investment. So if equity is the same, then the debt amount would be different. For Option X, with 4x leverage, debt = 4 * equity. For Option Y, debt = 7 * equity. So Option Y has more debt relative to equity.\n\nNow, financial risk is often tied to how much debt you have. Higher leverage means higher financial risk because if the investment doesn't perform well, the debt obligations are larger relative to equity. So even though both have the same IRR, the one with higher leverage (Option Y) would have more risk because the debt burden is higher.\n\nWait, but the IRR is levered, meaning it's after considering the debt. So the 22% IRR already factors in the debt. But the question is about financial risk, which relates to the risk of not being able to service the debt. Higher leverage means higher interest payments and more risk of default if cash flows dip.\n\nSince Option Y has 7x leverage compared to X's 4x, Y has more debt relative to equity. So even with the same equity investment, Y's debt is higher. Therefore, Y has greater financial risk.\n\nLet me double-check. Leverage ratio: 4x means debt/equity = 4, so total capital is 5x equity. 7x would be debt/equity =7, total capital 8x equity. But since equity is the same, the debt for Y is higher. So yes, higher debt means higher risk. So Option Y is riskier.\n</think>\n\nHigher leverage increases financial risk due to greater debt obligations relative to equity. Option Y uses 7x leverage compared to Option X's 4x, meaning Option Y has higher debt for the same equity investment. This amplifies risk from interest payments and potential default.\n\n<answer>:Option Y",

      "question": "If Company B funds an acquisition with debt, how could the resulting interest expenses and added income change its net earnings and shareholder returns (return on equity)?",
      "ground_truth": "Decrease Net Income and increase return on equity",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking about how Company B funding an acquisition with debt affects net earnings and shareholder returns, specifically return on equity (ROE). \n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics. When a company takes on debt, it incurs interest expenses. Interest is tax-deductible, so that might reduce taxable income, but the question is about net earnings. Net earnings are after interest and taxes. So, interest expense would decrease net earnings because it's an expense that reduces profit.\n\nNow, ROE is net income divided by shareholders' equity. If the company uses debt to acquire another company, the equity might not change immediately, but the net income could be affected. Wait, but if they use debt, the equity stays the same (assuming they don't issue new shares), but the interest expense reduces net income. So, if net income goes down, and equity remains the same, ROE would decrease. However, if the acquisition generates more earnings than the interest cost, maybe net income could increase. But the question doesn't specify that; it's a general case. So, typically, the interest expense would lower net earnings, leading to a lower ROE unless the acquisition is highly profitable.\n\nWait, but the question says \"resulting interest expenses and added income.\" Added income might refer to the income from the acquired company. But the question is phrased as \"how could the resulting interest expenses and added income change...\" So, the interest expense is a cost, and the added income is the revenue from the acquisition. So, the net effect on earnings depends on whether the added income exceeds the interest expense. If it does, net earnings might increase; if not, they decrease. But the question is about the general case, so maybe the answer should consider that interest expense reduces earnings, and if the acquisition's income is sufficient, it might offset, but typically, the interest expense is a direct cost that reduces earnings.\n\nFor ROE: ROE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity. If the company uses debt, equity remains the same (assuming no new equity issuance), so if net income decreases due to interest expense, ROE decreases. However, if the acquisition's income is high enough to make net income increase, then ROE would increase. But the question is phrased as \"how could\" so it's possible both ways, but the standard answer would be that interest expense reduces net earnings, thus lowering ROE unless the acquisition's returns exceed the cost of debt.\n\nWait, but the question says \"funds an acquisition with debt,\" so the debt is used to buy the company, so the interest expense is on the debt. The added income would be from the acquired company's operations. So, the net effect on earnings is (added income - interest expense). If added income > interest, net earnings up; else, down. But the question is about the effect on net earnings and ROE. So, the answer should state that interest expense reduces net earnings (unless offset by added income), and ROE would decrease if net earnings decrease, but could increase if added income exceeds interest.\n\nBut the question is probably expecting the standard case where the interest expense is a cost that reduces earnings, so net earnings decrease, leading to lower ROE. However, the exact answer might need to be concise. Let me check standard financial knowledge.\n\nWhen a company uses debt, the interest expense is a cost that reduces net income. Since ROE is net income divided by equity, if net income decreases and equity remains the same (because debt is used, not equity), ROE would decrease. However, if the acquisition generates returns higher than the cost of debt, net income could increase, leading to higher ROE. But the question is phrased as \"how could\" so it's possible both ways, but the primary effect is that interest expense reduces earnings, so typically ROE would decrease unless the acquisition is very profitable.\n\nBut the question might be looking for the direct effect: interest expense reduces net earnings, so if the added income from the acquisition isn't enough to offset the interest, net earnings go down, and ROE (since equity is unchanged) would decrease. So the answer should be that interest expense reduces net earnings, which would lower ROE unless the acquisition's income exceeds the interest cost.\n\nBut the question says \"how could the resulting interest expenses and added income change...\" So the answer needs to address both. But the standard answer expected here is probably that interest expense reduces net earnings, thus decreasing ROE, unless the added income from the acquisition is sufficient to offset the interest expense.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the effect on net earnings and shareholder returns (ROE). So, the answer should state that interest expense reduces net earnings (all else equal), which would decrease ROE. However, if the added income from the acquisition exceeds the interest expense, net earnings could increase, leading to higher ROE. But the question is phrased as \"how could,\" so it's possible both ways, but the typical case is that the interest expense is a cost that reduces earnings, so ROE would decrease.\n\nBut I think the expected answer here is that interest expense reduces net earnings, leading to a lower ROE, unless the acquisition's returns exceed the cost of debt. However, the question might be looking for the direct effect without considering the acquisition's success. So, the immediate effect of taking on debt is interest expense, which lowers net income, thus lowering ROE.\n\nWait, but ROE is net income over equity. If the company uses debt, equity remains the same (assuming no new equity), so if net income decreases, ROE decreases. So the answer is that interest expense reduces net earnings, which decreases ROE.\n\nBut the question mentions \"added income,\" so maybe the acquisition brings in more revenue. But the question is about the effect of the interest expense and the added income. So the net effect on earnings is (added income - interest expense). If added income > interest, earnings up; else, down. But the question is about how it could change, so the answer should cover both possibilities. However, in the context of a financial reasoning agent, the standard answer would be that interest expense reduces net earnings, thus lowering ROE, unless the acquisition's returns exceed the interest cost.\n\nBut the question is probably expecting the basic effect: debt increases interest expense, which reduces net income, and since equity isn't increased (debt is used), ROE decreases. So the answer is that net earnings decrease (due to interest expense), leading to a lower ROE.\n\nWait, but the question says \"how could the resulting interest expenses and added income change...\" So added income is from the acquisition. So the net effect on earnings is added income minus interest expense. So if added income > interest, net earnings increase; else, decrease. But the question is about the effect on net earnings and ROE. So the answer should state that if the added income exceeds the interest expense, net earnings increase and ROE may rise; otherwise, net earnings decrease and ROE falls. But the question is phrased as \"how could,\" so it's possible either way.\n\nHowever, in most cases, especially if the acquisition isn't immediately profitable, the interest expense would reduce net earnings. But the question is general. The standard answer expected here is probably that interest expense reduces net earnings, thus decreasing ROE, unless the acquisition's returns exceed the cost of debt.\n\nBut the problem is to provide a concise answer. The key points are:\n\n- Interest expense reduces net earnings (all else equal).\n- ROE = Net Income / Equity. If net income decreases and equity remains the same (since debt was used, not equity), ROE decreases.\n\nSo the final answer would be that interest expense reduces net earnings, leading to a lower ROE, unless the acquisition's income exceeds the interest cost.\n\nBut the question might want a more direct answer. Let me check some references. For example, using debt increases financial leverage. If the return on the acquired assets is higher than the cost of debt, ROE increases; otherwise, it decreases. So the effect on ROE depends on whether the acquisition's return exceeds the interest rate.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"how could,\" so the answer should mention that it could decrease net earnings and ROE if interest expense exceeds added income, or increase them if added income exceeds interest expense.\n\nBut the user wants a concise answer. The standard answer in finance is that debt increases financial risk; if the return on the acquisition is less than the cost of debt, net income and ROE decrease. If it's higher, they increase.\n\nBut the question is asking for the effect of the interest expenses and added income. So the answer should be: Interest expense reduces net earnings, which could lower ROE unless the added income from the acquisition exceeds the interest expense.\n\nBut the required answer format is concise. So the final answer should be something like: Interest expense reduces net earnings, potentially lowering ROE unless the acquisition's returns exceed the interest cost.\n\nBut the user wants the answer in a specific format. Let me see the instructions again. The final answer must be concise, in correct financial format.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n- Interest expense decreases net earnings.\n\n- ROE = Net Income / Equity; if net income decreases and equity unchanged, ROE decreases.\n\n- However, if the acquisition's income > interest expense, net earnings increase, ROE increases.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"how could,\" so the answer should cover both possibilities. But in many cases, especially in the short term, the interest expense might not be offset, so the answer might lean towards the negative effect.\n\nBut the most accurate answer is that it depends on whether the added income exceeds the interest expense. However, the question might expect the basic effect: debt increases interest expense, reducing net earnings and thus ROE.\n\nWait, but the question says \"resulting interest expenses and added income,\" so both factors. So the net effect on earnings is (added income - interest expense). So if added income > interest, earnings up; else, down. Therefore, net earnings could increase or decrease, and ROE would follow accordingly.\n\nBut the question is asking \"how could\" so the answer should state that if added income exceeds interest expense, net earnings and ROE increase; otherwise, they decrease.\n\nBut the answer needs to be concise. So the final answer would be: Net earnings may decrease due to interest expense, lowering ROE unless the acquisition's income exceeds the interest cost.\n\nBut the standard way to phrase this in finance is: Interest expense reduces net income, which decreases ROE unless the return on the acquired assets exceeds the cost of debt.\n\nSo the concise answer would be: Interest expense reduces net earnings, potentially decreasing ROE unless the acquisition's returns exceed the interest cost.\n\nBut the user wants it in a specific format. Let me check the example in the instructions. The final answer should start with <answer>: and be concise.\n\nSo, the answer should be: Net earnings decrease (due to interest expense), lowering ROE unless acquisition income exceeds interest cost.\n\nBut to make it more precise: Interest expense reduces net earnings, which decreases ROE unless the added income from the acquisition exceeds the interest expense.\n\nBut the question says \"added income,\" so the answer should use that term.\n\nSo, the final answer: Interest expense reduces net earnings, lowering ROE unless added income exceeds interest expense.\n\nYes, that's concise and covers the key points.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:Interest expense reduces net earnings, lowering ROE unless added income exceeds interest expense.",

      "question": "As a company takes on more debt, what happens to the company's WACC?",
      "ground_truth": "Decrease WACC",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about how a company's WACC changes as it takes on more debt. Let me recall what WACC stands for—Weighted Average Cost of Capital. It's the average rate a company pays to finance its assets, considering both debt and equity.\n\nHmm, the key here is understanding the components of WACC. WACC is calculated as (E/V)*Re + (D/V)*Rd*(1-Tc), where E is equity, D is debt, V is total value (E+D), Re is cost of equity, Rd is cost of debt, and Tc is the tax rate. \n\nWhen a company takes on more debt, D increases, so the debt ratio (D/V) goes up. Debt is usually cheaper than equity because interest is tax-deductible, so Rd*(1-Tc) is lower than Re. So, increasing debt should lower the WACC initially because you're replacing more expensive equity with cheaper debt. \n\nBut wait, there's a catch. As debt increases, the company becomes riskier. The cost of equity (Re) might rise because investors demand higher returns for the increased risk. Also, the cost of debt (Rd) might go up as lenders see higher risk. So, while the tax shield from debt lowers the cost, the increased risk could offset that benefit. \n\nHowever, the question is about what happens as the company takes on more debt, without specifying how much. In standard finance theory, up to a point, adding debt lowers WACC because the tax shield effect dominates. But beyond a certain point, the increased risk causes Re and Rd to rise, making WACC increase. But the question doesn't specify if it's a small or large increase in debt. \n\nTypically, in introductory finance contexts, the answer is that WACC decreases initially as debt increases. But the question says \"takes on more debt,\" which might imply a general trend. However, the standard answer taught is that WACC decreases with more debt due to the tax shield, until the point where financial distress costs kick in. But since the question doesn't mention distress, the expected answer is that WACC decreases. \n\nWait, but I should confirm. Let me think of an example. Suppose a company has no debt, so WACC equals cost of equity. Adding a little debt: the tax shield makes the after-tax cost of debt lower than equity, so WACC drops. As debt increases, the tax shield effect continues to lower WACC until the point where the increased risk makes equity cost rise more than the tax benefit. But the question is phrased generally, so the immediate effect is a decrease. \n\nIn most textbooks, the answer is that WACC decreases as debt increases, up to an optimal point. So for the purpose of this question, the answer should be that WACC decreases. \n\nBut I should make sure. Let me check a reliable source. For instance, in the Modigliani-Miller theorem with taxes, WACC decreases as debt increases because of the tax shield. So yes, the standard answer is that WACC decreases. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is that WACC decreases.\n</think>\n\nAs a company increases its debt, the WACC initially decreases due to the tax shield on interest payments (lowering the after-tax cost of debt) and the substitution of cheaper debt for more expensive equity. However, beyond an optimal debt level, increased financial risk raises both the cost of debt and equity, potentially increasing WACC. The question implies a general trend without specifying excessive debt, so the standard answer focuses on the initial effect: WACC decreases.\n\n<answer>:decreases",

      "question": "Two similar firms have identical operations but different funding methods: Firm A raises 60% through equity and 40% via debt, whereas Firm B relies solely on equity. How does Firm A's debt financing affect its cash flow statement versus Firm B?",
      "ground_truth": "CFO decreased, CFI unchanged, CFF potentially decreased",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, we have two firms, A and B. They're similar in operations but different in funding. Firm A has 60% equity and 40% debt, while Firm B is all equity. The question is about how Firm A's debt financing affects its cash flow statement compared to Firm B.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how debt financing impacts cash flows. Debt usually involves interest payments, which are cash outflows. Equity doesn't have that; dividends are discretionary but not mandatory like interest. So, Firm A would have interest payments as an operating cash outflow, whereas Firm B wouldn't have that.\n\nWait, but where do interest payments go on the cash flow statement? I think they're under operating activities because they're related to financing the business operations. So, Firm A's operating cash flow would be lower by the amount of interest paid compared to Firm B, which has no interest expense.\n\nAlso, debt repayment would be a financing activity. But the question is about the cash flow statement in general, not specifically which section. But the main difference would be the interest expense in operating cash flow. Firm B, being all equity, doesn't have interest, so their operating cash flow is higher by that amount.\n\nWait, but the question says \"how does Firm A's debt financing affect its cash flow statement versus Firm B?\" So, the key point is that Firm A has interest payments (cash outflow) in operating activities, while Firm B doesn't. Therefore, Firm A's operating cash flow is lower than Firm B's by the amount of interest paid. Also, if Firm A has debt repayments, that would be a financing cash outflow, but the question might be focusing on the interest part since it's about the cash flow statement's impact.\n\nAnother angle: Debt financing can lead to tax savings because interest is tax-deductible. So, Firm A might have lower taxes, which would increase operating cash flow. Wait, but the question is about the direct effect of debt financing on the cash flow statement. The interest payment is a cash outflow, but the tax shield would be a cash inflow from tax savings. However, the question might be simplifying and not considering tax effects, as it's a basic question. The main point is the interest payment as a cash outflow.\n\nSo, the primary difference is that Firm A has interest payments (cash outflow) in operating activities, whereas Firm B does not. Therefore, Firm A's operating cash flow is lower than Firm B's by the interest amount. The answer should state that Firm A's operating cash flow is lower due to interest payments, while Firm B has no such outflow.\n\nWait, but the question asks how Firm A's debt financing affects its cash flow statement versus Firm B. So, the answer should be that Firm A's cash flow statement shows interest payments as an operating cash outflow, reducing operating cash flow, whereas Firm B has no such outflow. So, Firm A's operating cash flow is lower than Firm B's by the amount of interest paid.\n\nI think that's the key point. Let me confirm. Yes, interest expense is an operating cash outflow for debt-financed firms. Equity firms don't have that. So, the answer is that Firm A's operating cash flow is lower due to interest payments, while Firm B's operating cash flow is higher (no interest expense).\n</think>\n\nFirm A's debt financing results in interest payments, which are recorded as an operating cash outflow, reducing its operating cash flow compared to Firm B. Firm B, with no debt, has no interest expense, leading to higher operating cash flow. The debt repayment (if any) would appear under financing activities, but the primary difference is the interest expense in operating cash flow.\n\n<answer>: Firm A's operating cash flow is lower due to interest payments; Firm B has no interest expense.",

      "question": "If we increase annual depreciation by 25 dollars, what effect does this have on the discounted cash flow analysis?",
      "ground_truth": "Increase valuation",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the effect of increasing annual depreciation by $25 on discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how depreciation affects cash flow. Depreciation is a non-cash expense, meaning it doesn't involve an actual outflow of cash. When calculating operating cash flow, we start with net income and add back depreciation because it was subtracted as an expense but didn't use cash. So, if depreciation increases by $25, net income would decrease by $25 (since depreciation is an expense). However, when we add back depreciation to get operating cash flow, the increase in depreciation would actually increase the operating cash flow by $25. Wait, let me make sure.\n\nLet me think step by step. Suppose original depreciation is D. Net income = Revenue - Expenses (including D). If D increases by $25, net income decreases by $25. But operating cash flow = Net income + Depreciation. So if net income goes down by $25 and we add back the higher depreciation (which is $25 more), the operating cash flow would increase by $25. Because the decrease in net income is offset by the higher depreciation added back. So the net effect on operating cash flow is +$25.\n\nNow, in DCF analysis, the cash flows used are after-tax cash flows. The tax effect: since depreciation is a tax-deductible expense, increasing depreciation by $25 would reduce taxable income by $25, leading to a tax savings of 25 * tax rate. Wait, but the question doesn't mention tax rate. Hmm. Wait, but the question is about the effect on DCF. Let's clarify.\n\nDepreciation affects taxes. If depreciation increases by $25, taxable income decreases by $25, so taxes decrease by 25 * tax rate. Therefore, the after-tax cash flow would increase by the tax savings. So the change in operating cash flow would be the increase from the tax shield. Wait, but the question says \"increase annual depreciation by 25 dollars\". So the tax shield effect is 25 * tax rate. However, the question doesn't specify the tax rate. But maybe the question is assuming that the tax rate is already factored in, or perhaps it's a trick question where depreciation is non-cash, so the direct effect on cash flow is the tax shield.\n\nWait, but the standard way to calculate operating cash flow is: Net Income + Depreciation. But Net Income is after taxes. So if depreciation increases by $25, then taxable income decreases by $25, so taxes decrease by 25 * t (where t is tax rate). Therefore, Net Income = (Revenue - Expenses - Depreciation) * (1 - t). So if Depreciation increases by 25, Net Income decreases by 25*(1 - t). Then, Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation. So the change in OCF would be [Net Income - 25*(1 - t)] + [Depreciation + 25] = Net Income + Depreciation + 25 - 25*(1 - t) = OCF + 25*t. So the increase in OCF is 25*t. But the question doesn't mention tax rate. However, the question is phrased as \"increase annual depreciation by 25 dollars\", and asks about the effect on DCF.\n\nBut the problem is that without knowing the tax rate, we can't give a numerical value. However, the question might be expecting the answer that it increases the cash flow by the tax shield, but since the tax rate isn't given, maybe the answer is that it increases the cash flow by $25*(1 - tax rate), but that's not a numerical answer. Wait, but the question might be oversimplified, assuming that the tax effect is already considered, or perhaps the question is a trick to see if you know that depreciation is a non-cash expense, so increasing it doesn't affect cash flow directly, but through taxes.\n\nWait, but in reality, the tax effect is crucial. For example, if the tax rate is 30%, then increasing depreciation by $25 would save $7.50 in taxes, so the cash flow increases by $7.50. But the question doesn't provide a tax rate, so maybe the answer is that it increases the cash flow by $25 multiplied by the tax rate, but since the question is probably expecting a simple answer, perhaps the standard answer is that it increases the cash flow by the tax shield, but without tax rate, maybe the answer is that it increases the cash flow by $25*(tax rate), but the question might be expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is a trick. Because depreciation is a non-cash expense, so when you increase depreciation, it reduces net income but doesn't affect cash. However, in the cash flow calculation, you add back depreciation. So if depreciation increases by $25, then when you add it back, the cash flow increases by $25. But wait, that's only if there's no tax effect. But in reality, the tax effect is part of it. Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose a company has revenue of $100, expenses (excluding depreciation) of $50, depreciation of $20. Tax rate is 30%.\n\nNet income = (100 - 50 - 20) * (1 - 0.3) = 30 * 0.7 = $21.\n\nOperating cash flow = Net income + Depreciation = 21 + 20 = $41.\n\nNow, increase depreciation by $25, so depreciation becomes $45.\n\nNet income = (100 - 50 - 45) * 0.7 = 5 * 0.7 = $3.5.\n\nOperating cash flow = 3.5 + 45 = $48.5.\n\nOriginal OCF was $41, new is $48.5, so increase of $7.5. Which is 25 * 0.3 = $7.5. So the increase in OCF is 25 * tax rate.\n\nTherefore, the effect is that the annual cash flow increases by $25 * tax rate. But since the tax rate isn't given, the answer can't be a specific dollar amount. However, the question might be expecting the answer to recognize that it increases the cash flow by the tax shield, but since the question is phrased as \"increase annual depreciation by 25 dollars\", and the answer needs to be in a specific format, perhaps the expected answer is that it increases the cash flow by $25*(tax rate), but the problem is that the question doesn't provide tax rate.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is a trick question. In some contexts, people might think that increasing depreciation (a non-cash expense) doesn't affect cash flow, but that's incorrect because of the tax effect. However, if the question is from a basic finance perspective that ignores taxes, then the answer would be that it increases cash flow by $25. But in reality, it's the tax shield that matters.\n\nBut the question is about discounted cash flow analysis. DCF uses after-tax cash flows. So the correct effect is that the cash flow increases by the tax savings from the higher depreciation. Since the tax rate isn't given, but the question is probably expecting a general answer, but the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the effect, not a numerical value. Wait, the question says \"what effect does this have\", so the answer should be that it increases the annual cash flow by $25 multiplied by the tax rate. But since the answer needs to be concise and in financial format, maybe the expected answer is that it increases the cash flow by $25*(tax rate), but the problem is that the question might be expecting a different answer.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"If we increase annual depreciation by 25 dollars, what effect does this have on the discounted cash flow analysis?\"\n\nIn many basic finance contexts, especially in exams, they might simplify and say that depreciation is a non-cash expense, so increasing it doesn't affect cash flow. But that's incorrect because of the tax effect. However, if the question is from a source that ignores taxes, then the answer would be no effect. But that's not right.\n\nWait, but let's think again. The standard formula for operating cash flow is EBIT*(1 - tax rate) + Depreciation. Wait, no: EBIT is Earnings Before Interest and Taxes. So EBIT = Revenue - Operating Expenses - Depreciation. Then, Net Income = EBIT*(1 - tax rate). Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation = EBIT*(1 - tax rate) + Depreciation.\n\nIf depreciation increases by $25, then EBIT decreases by $25, so EBIT*(1 - tax rate) decreases by 25*(1 - tax rate), and then adding back the higher depreciation (which is +25), so total OCF change is -25*(1 - tax rate) + 25 = 25*tax rate. So yes, the change is +25*tax rate.\n\nBut since the tax rate isn't given, the answer can't be a specific dollar amount. However, the question might be expecting the answer to state that it increases the cash flow by the tax shield amount, but the problem is that the answer needs to be in a specific format. The user instructions say \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\".\n\nWait, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is that it has no effect on cash flow because depreciation is non-cash. But that's incorrect. The correct answer is that it increases the cash flow by the tax savings, which is 25 * tax rate. But since tax rate isn't given, perhaps the answer is that it increases the annual cash flow by $25*(tax rate), but the problem is that the question might expect a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a context where taxes are not considered, so the answer is that it increases the cash flow by $25. But that's not accurate. However, in some simplified models, they might ignore taxes for the sake of the question.\n\nWait, the question says \"discounted cash flow analysis\". DCF typically uses after-tax cash flows, so taxes must be considered. Therefore, the correct effect is an increase in cash flow by the tax shield, which is 25 * tax rate. But since the tax rate isn't provided, the answer can't be numerical. However, the question might be expecting the answer to recognize that it increases the cash flow by $25 multiplied by the tax rate, but the problem is that the answer format requires a concise answer.\n\nWait, looking at the instructions: \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\". So perhaps the expected answer is that it increases the cash flow by $25*(tax rate), but since tax rate isn't given, maybe the answer is simply \"increases cash flow by $25*(tax rate)\" but that's not a standard financial format. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes a 100% tax rate or something, but that's not standard.\n\nWait, another angle: depreciation is a non-cash expense, so when you increase it, it doesn't affect cash flow directly. But in reality, it does affect cash flow through taxes. However, if the question is from a basic accounting perspective, they might say that since depreciation is non-cash, increasing it doesn't change cash flow. But that's wrong. The correct answer should account for the tax effect.\n\nBut given that the question is presented without tax rate, perhaps the intended answer is that it increases the cash flow by $25. But that's incorrect. However, maybe the question is testing the knowledge that depreciation is non-cash, so the answer is no effect. But that's also incorrect.\n\nWait, let's check some references. In finance, when you increase depreciation, it reduces taxable income, thus reducing taxes paid, which increases cash flow. The amount of increase is the tax rate times the increase in depreciation. So the effect is a positive change in cash flow equal to ΔDepreciation * tax rate.\n\nSince the question doesn't provide tax rate, but asks for the effect, the answer should state that it increases the annual cash flow by $25 multiplied by the tax rate. But the problem is that the answer needs to be concise. However, the user instructions say \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\".\n\nWait, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is \"no effect\" because depreciation is non-cash. But that's a common misconception. The correct answer is that it increases cash flow by the tax shield. But without tax rate, we can't give a number. However, the question might be expecting the answer to recognize the tax effect, but since it's a multiple-choice or short answer, perhaps the answer is \"increases cash flow by $25*(tax rate)\".\n\nBut the user's instructions say to provide the final answer in the required format. Given that, and the fact that the tax rate isn't provided, the most accurate answer is that it increases the cash flow by the tax shield amount, which is $25 multiplied by the tax rate. But since the answer needs to be concise, perhaps the expected answer is \"increases cash flow by $25*(tax rate)\".\n\nWait, but the problem is that the user might expect a numerical answer. However, the question doesn't provide tax rate, so it's impossible to give a numerical value. Therefore, the answer should state the effect in terms of the tax rate.\n\nBut looking at similar questions, sometimes they assume that the tax rate is 0, but that's not realistic. Alternatively, maybe the question is from a context where taxes are ignored, so the answer is that it increases cash flow by $25. But I think that's incorrect.\n\nWait, let's think about the cash flow statement. Operating cash flow is calculated as net income plus non-cash expenses. If depreciation increases by $25, net income decreases by $25 (assuming no tax effect), so adding back depreciation would mean OCF increases by $25. But this ignores taxes. If taxes are considered, then the decrease in net income is less because of the tax shield.\n\nBut in reality, the tax effect is part of it. So the correct answer should include the tax rate. However, since the question doesn't provide it, the answer must be phrased generally.\n\nBut the user's instructions say \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\". So perhaps the expected answer is \"increases cash flow by $25*(tax rate)\", but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is designed to test the knowledge that depreciation is non-cash, so the answer is \"no effect\", but that's wrong.\n\nWait, another way: in DCF, the cash flow is after-tax. So the increase in depreciation reduces taxes, so the cash flow increases by the tax savings. So the effect is a positive change in cash flow equal to the tax rate times $25. Since tax rate is not given, the answer should state that it increases the cash flow by $25 multiplied by the tax rate.\n\nBut the problem is that the answer needs to be in a box, concise. Maybe the expected answer is simply \"increases cash flow by $25*(tax rate)\", but I'm not sure. However, given that the question is likely from a basic finance course that might not have covered tax effects in this context, the answer might be \"increases cash flow by $25\".\n\nBut I think the correct answer is that it increases the cash flow by the tax shield, which is $25 * tax rate. Since the question doesn't provide tax rate, but the answer must be concise, perhaps the answer is \"increases cash flow by $25*(tax rate)\".\n\nWait, but the user's example in the instructions says \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\". So maybe the expected answer is simply \"increases cash flow by $25\" but that's incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that the tax rate is 100%, but that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where the answer is \"no effect\" because depreciation is non-cash. But that's a common mistake. The correct answer is that it increases cash flow due to tax savings.\n\nGiven that, and since the question is about DCF, which uses after-tax cash flows, the answer should be that it increases the annual cash flow by $25 multiplied by the tax rate. But since the tax rate isn't given, the answer can't be numerical. However, the problem might expect the answer to state the effect without numbers, like \"increases cash flow\".\n\nBut the user instructions say \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\". So perhaps the answer is \"increases cash flow by $25*(tax rate)\", but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the answer to be \"increases cash flow by $25\" ignoring taxes, which is a common error.\n\nWait, let's check a textbook. For example, in the context of capital budgeting, when you increase depreciation, it increases the tax shield, thus increasing cash flow. The formula is ΔCF = ΔDepreciation * tax rate.\n\nSo the effect is an increase in cash flow equal to 25 * tax rate. Since tax rate is not given, the answer must be phrased as such. But the problem is that the answer needs to be in a box, so perhaps the expected answer is \"increases cash flow by $25*(tax rate)\".\n\nBut the user might be expecting a different answer. Given that, and considering that the question might be from a source that overlooks taxes, the answer might be \"increases cash flow by $25\". But I think that's incorrect.\n\nWait, another angle: the question says \"annual depreciation\", so it's a recurring increase. In DCF, each year's cash flow would increase by the tax shield. So the effect is a positive change in each year's cash flow by 25*tax rate.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify tax rate, the answer can't be numerical. Therefore, the correct answer is that it increases the annual cash flow by $25 multiplied by the tax rate.\n\nHowever, the user instructions require the answer to be concise. So perhaps the answer is \"increases cash flow by $25*(tax rate)\".\n\nBut I need to check if there's a standard way to phrase this. In finance, it's common to say that the tax shield from depreciation is depreciation * tax rate, so the cash flow increases by that amount.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is that it increases the cash flow by $25 multiplied by the tax rate. But since the tax rate isn't provided, the answer must include that.\n\nBut the problem is that the user might expect a different answer. However, based on financial principles, this is the correct effect.\n\nSo, the final answer should be that the discounted cash flow analysis shows an increase in annual cash flow by $25*(tax rate). But since the answer needs to be concise, perhaps \"increases cash flow by $25 × tax rate\".\n\nBut the user's example says \"in the correct financial format\", so maybe it's written as \"increases by $25 × tax rate\".\n\nHowever, the instructions say \"the final answer must be concise\", so perhaps the answer is simply \"increases cash flow by $25*(tax rate)\".\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the options, I think the best answer is that it increases the cash flow by the tax shield amount, which is $25 multiplied by the tax rate. So the answer should reflect that.\n\nBut since the question is presented without tax rate, and the answer must be concise, I'll go with stating the effect as increasing cash flow by $25*(tax rate).\n</think>\n\n<answer>:increases cash flow by $25 × tax rate",

      "question": "A manufacturing company has an EV/EBITDA multiple of 12x and a P/E ratio of 12x. From this information, how much net debt does this company have? ",
      "ground_truth": "EBITDA * 6",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about a manufacturing company with an EV/EBITDA multiple of 12x and a P/E ratio of 12x. The question asks for the net debt. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what EV/EBITDA and P/E ratios represent. EV stands for Enterprise Value, which is the total value of the company including debt and equity, minus cash. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. So EV/EBITDA is a valuation multiple.\n\nP/E ratio is Price to Earnings, which is the market capitalization divided by net income. Market cap is the value of equity, so P/E = Market Cap / Net Income.\n\nThe company has EV/EBITDA = 12x and P/E = 12x. Let me write down the formulas.\n\nEV = EBITDA * 12\n\nMarket Cap = Net Income * 12\n\nNow, Enterprise Value (EV) is calculated as Market Cap + Debt - Cash. So EV = Market Cap + Net Debt (assuming no cash, or net debt is debt minus cash). Wait, net debt is usually debt minus cash, so EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash = Market Cap + Net Debt.\n\nBut the question is asking for net debt. So if I can find EV and Market Cap, then Net Debt = EV - Market Cap.\n\nGiven that EV = 12 * EBITDA and Market Cap = 12 * Net Income.\n\nBut I need to relate EBITDA and Net Income. EBITDA is Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization. So EBITDA = EBIT + D&A. EBIT is Earnings Before Interest and Taxes, so EBIT = Net Income + Taxes + Interest.\n\nBut without knowing the tax rate or interest expense, how can I relate EBITDA and Net Income?\n\nWait, maybe there's a standard relationship. Let's assume that EBITDA and Net Income are related through taxes and interest. But without specific numbers, maybe the key is that if EV/EBITDA and P/E are the same, then EV = Market Cap, which would imply that Net Debt is zero.\n\nWait, let's check that. If EV = Market Cap, then EV = Market Cap + Net Debt - Cash? Wait, no. EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash. So if EV = Market Cap, then Debt - Cash = 0, so Net Debt = 0.\n\nBut why would EV equal Market Cap? If EV/EBITDA = P/E, then (Market Cap + Debt - Cash)/EBITDA = Market Cap / Net Income.\n\nBut if both multiples are 12, then:\n\n(Market Cap + Debt - Cash)/EBITDA = 12\n\nMarket Cap / Net Income = 12\n\nSo, (Market Cap + Net Debt)/EBITDA = 12 (assuming Net Debt = Debt - Cash)\n\nAnd Market Cap / Net Income = 12\n\nBut unless EBITDA and Net Income are related such that EBITDA = Net Income, which would require that interest and taxes are zero, but that's not realistic. However, if the multiples are equal, maybe the only way that happens is if Net Debt is zero.\n\nWait, let's suppose that EBITDA = Net Income. Then EV/EBITDA = 12 would mean EV = 12 * EBITDA = 12 * Net Income. And P/E = 12 means Market Cap = 12 * Net Income. So EV = Market Cap, which implies that EV = Market Cap + Net Debt (since EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash = Market Cap + Net Debt). So if EV = Market Cap, then Net Debt must be zero.\n\nBut is EBITDA equal to Net Income? Normally, EBITDA is higher than Net Income because it's before interest and taxes. So unless the company has no interest expense and no taxes, which is unlikely, EBITDA would be higher than Net Income. But the problem states that both multiples are 12x. So if EBITDA is higher than Net Income, then for EV/EBITDA to equal P/E, EV must be higher than Market Cap by the same ratio.\n\nWait, let's plug in numbers. Suppose EBITDA = 100, so EV = 12 * 100 = 1200.\n\nIf P/E is 12, then Market Cap = 12 * Net Income. Let's say Net Income is X, so Market Cap = 12X.\n\nBut EV = Market Cap + Net Debt. So 1200 = 12X + Net Debt.\n\nBut EBITDA = EBIT + D&A. EBIT = Net Income + Taxes + Interest. So EBITDA = Net Income + Taxes + Interest + D&A. So EBITDA > Net Income unless Taxes, Interest, and D&A are zero.\n\nBut without knowing those values, how can we proceed? The problem must be designed so that the answer is zero, because otherwise, there's not enough information. The question is probably testing the understanding that if EV/EBITDA equals P/E, then Net Debt is zero.\n\nWait, let's think again. EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash = Market Cap + Net Debt.\n\nEV/EBITDA = 12\n\nP/E = Market Cap / Net Income = 12\n\nSo EV = 12 * EBITDA\n\nMarket Cap = 12 * Net Income\n\nTherefore, 12 * EBITDA = 12 * Net Income + Net Debt\n\nSo Net Debt = 12*(EBITDA - Net Income)\n\nBut EBITDA - Net Income = (EBIT + D&A) - (EBIT - Interest - Taxes - D&A?) Wait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nEBITDA = EBIT + D&A\n\nEBIT = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes = Net Income + Taxes + Interest\n\nSo EBITDA = (Net Income + Taxes + Interest) + D&A\n\nTherefore, EBITDA - Net Income = Taxes + Interest + D&A\n\nSo Net Debt = 12*(Taxes + Interest + D&A)\n\nBut unless Taxes, Interest, and D&A are zero, Net Debt would be positive. However, the problem doesn't provide any information about these. So the only way the question can be answered is if the answer is zero, implying that EBITDA = Net Income, which would require Taxes + Interest + D&A = 0. But that's not realistic, but maybe in the context of the problem, it's assumed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question. If EV/EBITDA and P/E are the same, then the company has no debt. Wait, but why?\n\nWait, another approach: The EV/EBITDA multiple is 12, and P/E is 12. Let's assume that EBITDA and Net Income are related. If the company has no interest expense and no taxes, then EBITDA = EBIT = Net Income. So EBITDA = Net Income. Then EV = 12 * EBITDA = 12 * Net Income. Market Cap = 12 * Net Income. So EV = Market Cap, which implies that EV = Market Cap + Net Debt => Net Debt = 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is zero.\n\nBut is this the intended reasoning? The problem probably expects that since the multiples are equal, the company has no net debt. So the answer is $0.\n</think>\n\nThe EV/EBITDA multiple (12x) and P/E ratio (12x) being equal implies that Enterprise Value (EV) equals Market Capitalization (Market Cap). Since EV = Market Cap + Net Debt (assuming no cash), the equality EV = Market Cap requires Net Debt to be zero.\n\n<answer>:0",

      "question": "Imagine two comparable firms that earn identical operating income. Firm X is financed with 60% equity and 40% debt, while Firm Y is completely equity-funded. How does Firm X's interest expense on debt affect its net income relative to Firm Y's net income?",
      "ground_truth": "Firm X has less net income relative to Firm Y",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, we have two firms, X and Y, both with the same operating income. Firm X has 60% equity and 40% debt, while Firm Y is all equity. The question is about how Firm X's interest expense affects its net income compared to Firm Y.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that operating income is the same for both. Operating income is before interest and taxes. So, for Firm Y, which has no debt, there's no interest expense. Therefore, their net income would be operating income minus taxes. But Firm X has debt, so they have to pay interest on that debt. Interest is a deductible expense, so it reduces taxable income. \n\nWait, but the question is about net income relative to Firm Y. Let's break it down. Both start with the same operating income. Firm X has to pay interest, which reduces their taxable income. So, their taxable income is operating income minus interest. Then they pay taxes on that lower amount. Firm Y doesn't have interest, so their taxable income is just operating income, leading to higher taxes. \n\nWait, but the key point here is that interest expense reduces net income. Even though interest is tax-deductible, the net effect is still that Firm X's net income is lower than Firm Y's because they have to pay interest. Let me think. Suppose operating income is $100 for both. Firm Y has no interest, so net income is $100 minus taxes. Firm X has, say, $40 debt at 5% interest, so $2 interest expense. So their taxable income is $100 - $2 = $98. If tax rate is 30%, Firm Y pays $30 tax, net income $70. Firm X pays $29.4 tax (30% of 98), so net income is $98 - $29.4 = $68.6. So Firm X's net income is lower than Firm Y's. \n\nTherefore, Firm X's interest expense reduces its net income compared to Firm Y. The answer should be that Firm X's net income is lower than Firm Y's due to the interest expense.\n</think>\n\nFirm X incurs interest expense on its debt, which reduces its taxable income and thus net income. Firm Y, with no debt, has no interest expense and therefore higher net income than Firm X for the same operating income.\n\n<answer>:lower",

      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this financial question. The firm is acquiring machinery for $250 in cash. I need to figure out how this affects the primary financial statements: balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.\n\nFirst, the balance sheet. When they buy machinery with cash, the machinery (a fixed asset) increases by $250. But since they're paying cash, the cash account decreases by $250. So on the balance sheet, assets go up in one category and down in another, keeping total assets the same. The equation remains balanced: Assets = Liabilities + Equity.\n\nNext, the income statement. This transaction is a purchase of an asset, not an expense. So no immediate impact on revenue or expenses. Depreciation might come later, but the initial purchase doesn't affect the income statement.\n\nThen, the cash flow statement. The cash outflow for the purchase would be shown under investing activities. So cash used in investing activities increases by $250, which reduces the cash balance.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The question says \"acquires a piece of machinery for 250 with cash.\" So it's a direct cash payment. So yes, cash decreases, machinery (property, plant, equipment) increases. No effect on liabilities or equity. Income statement unaffected. Cash flow: investing outflow.\n\nSo the primary statements affected are the balance sheet (asset exchange) and cash flow statement (investing activity). The income statement isn't affected here.\n\nThe answer should summarize the effects concisely. The key points are: Balance Sheet: +Machinery (PP&E), -Cash; Cash Flow: Investing outflow of $250. Income Statement: No effect.\n\nBut the question asks to demonstrate the effect on the primary financial statements. So the answer needs to state the changes. The final answer should be concise, so maybe list the statements affected and the specific changes.\n\nWait, the instructions say \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\" So perhaps just state the effects clearly.\n\nLooking at examples, usually for such questions, the answer would note that on the balance sheet, assets are exchanged (cash down, machinery up), cash flow statement shows a $250 outflow in investing activities, and income statement unchanged.\n\nSo the concise answer would be: Balance Sheet: Cash decreases $250, Machinery increases $250; Cash Flow Statement: Investing activities decrease $250; Income Statement: No effect.\n\nBut need to make sure it's in the correct format. Maybe the standard way is to list each statement's effect.\n\nYes, so the answer should state the three statements' effects. But since the question says \"primary financial statements,\" which are balance sheet, income statement, cash flow.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash -250, Machinery +250; Cash Flow: Investing -250; Income Statement: No effect.\n\nBut need to check if the numbers are correct. The machinery is acquired for 250, so yes, +250 in machinery, -250 in cash. Cash flow investing outflow of 250.\n\nYes, that's right. So the answer should be phrased concisely.\n</think>\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash decreases $250, Machinery (PP&E) increases $250; Cash Flow Statement: Investing activities decrease $250; Income Statement: No effect.\n\n<answer>:Balance Sheet: Cash -250, Machinery +250; Cash Flow: Investing -250; Income Statement: No effect",

      "ground_truth": "On the income statement, pre-tax income goes down by 100, and net income is down by 80. On the cash flow statement, net income is down by 80, but you add back 100 because it was a non-cash expense, so cash is up by 20. On the balance sheet, cash is up by 20, some sort of PP&E or asset is down by 100, which means assets are down by 80. Since net income, which is in shareholders equity is down by 80, the balance sheet balances.",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about the impact of a $100 asset write-down at a 20% tax rate on financial statements. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that an asset write-down reduces the asset value on the balance sheet. So the asset account would decrease by $100. But since it's a write-down, it's likely an expense, which would hit the income statement.\n\nOn the income statement, the $100 write-down would be recorded as an expense. This reduces pre-tax income by $100. Then, with a 20% tax rate, the tax benefit would be 20% of $100, which is $20. So net income would decrease by $80 ($100 - $20).\n\nNow, for the balance sheet: the asset is down $100, and retained earnings (part of equity) would decrease by the net effect on income, which is $80. The tax benefit of $20 would reduce the tax payable, but since it's a write-down, it's more about the tax savings reducing the tax expense. Wait, actually, the tax rate applies to the income, so the tax expense decreases by $20, meaning the company pays $20 less in taxes. So the cash flow from operations might be affected, but the question is about the financial statements, not cash flow.\n\nWait, the income statement shows the expense, then tax expense is reduced by $20, so net income is $80 less. Then, on the balance sheet, assets decrease by $100 (the write-down), and equity decreases by $80 (since net income decreased by $80). The tax benefit would affect the tax payable, but since it's a reduction in tax expense, it's already accounted for in the net income. So the balance sheet would have assets down $100, equity down $80, and the difference of $20 would be a reduction in tax payable or something else? Hmm.\n\nWait, no. The write-down is an expense, so income before tax decreases by $100. Tax expense decreases by 20% of $100 = $20, so tax expense is $20 less. Therefore, net income decreases by $80. So the balance sheet: assets (the asset being written down) decrease by $100. Equity (retained earnings) decreases by $80. The $20 tax benefit would be reflected in the tax payable or deferred tax, but typically, for a write-down, the tax effect is immediate, so tax payable would decrease by $20, but that's part of the balance sheet. Wait, but the question is about the effect on each financial statement, so I need to specify for each statement.\n\nSo, for the income statement: expense increases by $100, tax expense decreases by $20, so net income decreases by $80.\n\nBalance sheet: assets decrease by $100 (the asset write-down), equity decreases by $80 (due to lower net income), and tax payable decreases by $20 (since tax expense is lower). But tax payable is a liability, so liability decreases by $20. Wait, but the tax benefit is a reduction in tax expense, so the company would have a lower tax liability, meaning tax payable decreases by $20. So the balance sheet would show assets down $100, liabilities down $20, and equity down $80. But assets - liabilities = equity, so the changes should balance: -100 (assets) = -20 (liabilities) -80 (equity), which is correct.\n\nBut the question is asking for the effect on each financial statement. So the answer should state for each statement what changes.\n\nBut the user might expect a concise answer. Let me check standard accounting treatment.\n\nA write-down of an asset (like impairment) is recorded as an expense. So:\n\n- Income Statement: Operating expense increases by $100, leading to a $100 decrease in pre-tax income. Tax expense decreases by $20 (20% of $100), so net income decreases by $80.\n\n- Balance Sheet: Asset (e.g., Property, Plant, Equipment) decreases by $100. Retained earnings (equity) decreases by $80. Tax payable (liability) decreases by $20.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: The write-down is a non-cash expense, so it's added back in operating activities, but the question doesn't ask for cash flow, so maybe not needed.\n\nBut the question is about the effect on each financial statement, so the answer should mention the changes on each.\n\nBut the user wants the final answer in a concise format. The instructions say \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\"\n\nSo perhaps the answer should list the effects on each statement.\n\nBut how to phrase it concisely.\n\nTypically, for such questions, the answer might be:\n\nIncome Statement: Net income decreases by $80.\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets decrease by $100, Equity decreases by $80.\n\nBut the tax effect on liabilities might be part of it, but maybe the question expects the main points.\n\nWait, the tax rate is 20%, so the tax benefit is $20, so the net effect on net income is $100 - $20 = $80 decrease.\n\nSo the key points are:\n\n- Income Statement: Net income down $80.\n\n- Balance Sheet: Assets down $100, Equity down $80 (since the tax benefit reduces the liability, but the main equity impact is from net income).\n\nBut to be precise, the balance sheet changes are:\n\n- Asset: -100\n\n- Liability: -20 (tax payable)\n\n- Equity: -80\n\nBut the question might not require the liability part, just the main effects.\n\nIn many textbooks, the focus is on the asset and equity impact, with the tax effect being part of the income statement.\n\nSo the standard answer would be:\n\nIncome Statement: Net income decreases by $80.\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets decrease by $100, Equity decreases by $80.\n\nCash Flow Statement: Not affected (since it's a non-cash expense), but the question might not require it.\n\nBut the user's question says \"each financial statement,\" so probably income, balance, and cash flow.\n\nBut the cash flow would have the $80 added back in operating activities (since it's a non-cash expense), but the question is about the write-down effect, so the cash flow impact is that operating cash flow increases by $80 (because the expense is added back), but the question might not need that.\n\nGiven the instructions, the answer should be concise. So the main points are:\n\n- Income Statement: Net income decreases by $80.\n\n- Balance Sheet: Assets decrease by $100, Equity decreases by $80.\n\nBut to confirm, let's calculate:\n\nWrite-down: $100 expense.\n\nPre-tax income: -100.\n\nTax rate 20%, so tax benefit: $20 (reduces tax expense), so net income: -100 + 20 = -80.\n\nSo net income down $80.\n\nBalance sheet: Asset (e.g., asset account) down $100.\n\nEquity: down $80 (since net income decreased by $80).\n\nTax payable: down $20 (since tax expense decreased by $20), so liability down $20.\n\nBut the question might not require the liability part, so the answer focuses on assets and equity.\n\nSo the concise answer would be:\n\nIncome Statement: Net income decreases by $80.\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets decrease by $100, Equity decreases by $80.\n\nBut the user wants the answer in a specific format. The instructions say \"the final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\"\n\nSo perhaps the answer should be phrased as:\n\nIncome Statement: Net income ↓ $80; Balance Sheet: Assets ↓ $100, Equity ↓ $80.\n\nBut to make it even more concise, maybe:\n\nNet income decreases $80; Assets decrease $100, Equity decreases $80.\n\nBut the question says \"affect each financial statement,\" so need to specify per statement.\n\nLooking at examples, sometimes they list the changes per statement.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nIncome Statement: Net income decreases by $80. Balance Sheet: Assets decrease by $100, Equity decreases by $80.\n\nBut the user wants it in a very concise format. Maybe using symbols.\n\nBut the instructions say \"correct financial format,\" so probably using words.\n\nWait, the example in the instructions says \"final answer must be concise,\" so perhaps:\n\n<answer>: Income Statement: Net income -80; Balance Sheet: Assets -100, Equity -80\n\nBut need to check if that's standard.\n\nAlternatively, using \"↓\" for decrease.\n\nBut the user might expect a specific phrasing.\n\nAnother way: The write-down reduces net income by $80, decreases assets by $100, and decreases equity by $80.\n\nSo the concise answer would be:\n\nNet income decreases $80; Assets decrease $100; Equity decreases $80.\n\nBut to specify each statement, perhaps:\n\nIncome Statement: Net income ↓ $80; Balance Sheet: Assets ↓ $100, Equity ↓ $80.\n\nYes, that's standard.\n\nSo the final answer should be that.\n\nNow, check if the tax rate is applied correctly. The write-down is $100, tax rate 20%, so tax benefit is $20, so net effect on income is $80.

Gain on sales is a non-cash expense, reducing cash flow from operations by $60, leaving cash flow from operations down by $12. In the investing activities, proceeds from asset sales increase by $120, leaving cash overall up $120 -$12 = $108. \nOn the balance sheet, cash is up by $108, and PP&E is down by $60, leaving assets up $48. Shareholders equity is increased by $48 as well due to the increase in net income.",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this financial question. So, the company is disposing of an asset that was booked at 60, and they receive 120 in proceeds. I need to figure out how this affects the three financial statements with a 20% tax rate.\n\nFirst, I should recall that when you dispose of an asset, the gain or loss is calculated as the proceeds minus the book value. Here, book value is 60, proceeds are 120. So the gain is 120 - 60 = 60. But since there's a tax rate, I need to account for taxes on that gain.\n\nThe tax on the gain would be 20% of 60, which is 12. So the after-tax gain is 60 - 12 = 48. Wait, no, actually, the gain is taxable, so the company will pay tax on the gain, reducing the net cash received. So the net proceeds after tax would be 120 - (20% of 60) = 120 - 12 = 108. But I think the gain is recognized, and then tax is paid, so the cash flow from operating activities would be affected by the net gain.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step. The asset is removed from the balance sheet at its book value of 60. The cash received is 120. So the gain on sale is 60. Then, tax on that gain is 20% of 60 = 12. So the company will pay $12 in taxes, which reduces the cash flow.\n\nNow, for the financial statements:\n\n1. Income Statement: The gain on sale of asset is $60. Then, tax expense of $12 is recorded. So net income increases by $48 (60 - 12).\n\n2. Cash Flow Statement: The cash received from the sale is $120, but since it's an investing activity, it's a cash inflow of $120. However, the tax paid on the gain is part of operating activities? Wait, no. The tax on the gain is a separate item. Wait, the tax expense is part of the income statement, but the cash paid for taxes would be in operating activities. But in this case, the tax is on the gain, so the cash outflow for taxes would be $12, which is part of operating cash flow. But the sale itself is an investing activity. So the cash flow from investing activities would be +120, and cash flow from operating activities would have a tax payment of -12. But sometimes, the tax on the gain is considered part of the investing activity. Hmm, I need to be careful.\n\nWait, in the cash flow statement, the proceeds from sale of assets are investing activities. The tax paid on the gain is part of operating activities because it's related to the income statement. So the cash flow from investing is +120, and cash flow from operating is -12 (tax paid). But the net effect on cash is +120 -12 = +108. But the question is about how the transaction affects the three statements, not the cash flow statement's line items.\n\n3. Balance Sheet: The asset (PP&E) is removed at 60, so PP&E decreases by 60. Cash increases by 120, but then tax paid reduces cash by 12, so net cash increase is 108. So cash up by 108, PP&E down by 60. Retained earnings increase by the net gain of 48 (since net income increased by 48, which flows to retained earnings).\n\nWait, let's confirm:\n\n- Income Statement: Gain on sale = 60, tax expense = 12, so net income +48.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Investing activities: +120 (proceeds from sale). Operating activities: -12 (tax paid on gain). So total cash flow from operations and investing would be +120 -12 = +108, but the cash flow statement separates them.\n\n- Balance Sheet: Cash increases by 108 (120 received minus 12 tax paid). PP&E decreases by 60 (asset removed). Retained earnings increases by 48 (net income).\n\nWait, but the asset was booked at 60, so when sold, the asset is removed at 60, so the balance sheet shows a decrease in PP&E by 60. The cash increases by 120, but then tax is paid, so cash is 120 - 12 = 108. So cash up 108, PP&E down 60, retained earnings up 48.\n\nSo the three statements:\n\n- Income Statement: +$60 gain, -$12 tax, net +$48.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Investing +$120, Operating -$12 (tax), so net cash flow +$108.\n\n- Balance Sheet: Cash +$108, PP&E -$60, Retained Earnings +$48.\n\nBut the question asks how the transaction affects the three financial statements. So the answer should summarize the effects.\n\nWait, the standard way to present this is:\n\n- Income Statement: Increase in net income by $48 (after tax).\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Cash from investing activities increases by $120, but cash from operating activities decreases by $12 (tax), so net cash flow increases by $108.\n\n- Balance Sheet: Cash increases by $108, PP&E decreases by $60, Retained Earnings increases by $48.\n\nBut the question might expect a concise answer. Let me check if I did the tax correctly.\n\nGain = 120 - 60 = 60. Tax rate 20%, so tax = 12. So net gain = 60 - 12 = 48. So yes.\n\nSo the effects:\n\n- Income Statement: +$48 net income.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: +$120 investing, -$12 operating (tax), so total cash +$108.\n\n- Balance Sheet: Cash +$108, PP&E -$60, RE +$48.\n\nBut the question says \"how would this transaction affect the three financial statements\". So the answer should list the changes for each.\n\nBut the user wants the final answer in a specific format. The instructions say to provide the final answer concisely in the correct financial format.\n\nLooking at similar questions, the standard answer would be:\n\nIncome Statement: +$48 net income\n\nCash Flow Statement: +$120 investing, -$12 tax (operating), net cash +$108\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash +$108, PP&E -$60, Retained Earnings +$48\n\nBut maybe they want it summarized as:\n\nIncome Statement: +$48\n\nCash Flow: +$120 (investing), -$12 (tax)\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash +$108, PP&E -$60, RE +$48\n\nBut the exact wording might vary. Let me check if the tax is considered part of the operating cash flow. Yes, the tax paid on the gain is part of operating activities, so the tax payment is an operating cash outflow.\n\nSo the cash flow statement would show:\n\nOperating: -$12\n\nInvesting: +$120\n\nSo the net effect on cash is +$108.\n\nBut the question is about the effect on the three statements, so the answer should state the changes.\n\nIn the final answer, they want it concise. So perhaps:\n\nIncome Statement: +$48 net income\n\nCash Flow Statement: +$120 investing, -$12 operating\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash +$108, PP&E -$60, RE +$48\n\nBut the user might want it in a specific format. Let me see if there's a standard way.\n\nAnother way: The transaction results in a $60 gain, $12 tax, so net $48 to income. Cash received $120, tax paid $12, so net cash inflow $108. Balance sheet: asset removed at 60, cash up 108, retained earnings up 48.\n\nSo the concise answer would list the effects on each statement.\n\nBut the user says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\".\n\nLooking at examples, sometimes they list the changes as:\n\n- Income Statement: +$48\n\n- Cash Flow: +$120 (investing), -$12 (tax)\n\n- Balance Sheet: Cash +$108, PP&E -$60, RE +$48\n\nBut to make it concise, perhaps:\n\nIncome: +$48; Cash Flow: +$120 (investing), -$12 (tax); Balance Sheet: Cash +$108, PP&E -$60, RE +$48\n\nBut the exact wording might need to be precise.\n\nWait, the tax is part of the income statement, so the tax expense is $12, which reduces net income. So the income statement shows a gain of $60, tax expense of $12, net income +$48.\n\nCash flow: the $120 is a cash inflow from investing, and the tax paid is a cash outflow from operating, so operating cash flow decreases by $12.\n\nBalance sheet: cash increases by $120 - $12 = $108, PP&E decreases by $60 (book value), retained earnings increases by $48.\n\nSo the answer should reflect that.\n\nI think the standard way to present this is:\n\nIncome Statement: Net income increases by $48.\n\nCash Flow Statement: Cash from investing activities increases by $120; cash from operating activities decreases by $12 (tax).\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash increases by $108, Property, Plant & Equipment decreases by $60, Retained Earnings increases by $48.\n\nBut for conciseness, maybe:\n\nIncome: +$48; Cash Flow: +$120 (investing), -$12 (tax); Balance Sheet: Cash +$108, PP&E -$60, RE +$48\n\nYes, that's concise.\n\nSo the final answer should be in that format.\n</think>\n\nIncome Statement: +$48 net income  \nCash Flow Statement: +$120 (investing), -$12 (tax)  \nBalance Sheet: Cash +$108, PP&E -$60, RE +$48  \n\n<answer>:Income: +$48; Cash Flow: +$120 (investing), -$12 (tax); Balance Sheet: Cash +$108, PP&E -$60, RE +$48",

      "question": "A company spends 15 dollars in cash to purchase more inventory. Assuming a 35% income tax rate, how would this transaction influence the firm's financial statements?",
      "ground_truth": "On the income statement, nothing happens. On the cash flow statement, cash is down by 15 in CFO for purchasing inventory. On the balance sheet, cash is down by 15 and inventory is up by 15, balancing the balance sheet.",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the company spends $15 in cash to purchase more inventory. The question is about how this affects the financial statements, considering a 35% income tax rate.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic accounting principles. When a company buys inventory, it's an asset exchange. Cash (an asset) decreases, and inventory (another asset) increases. So, the transaction is just moving money from one asset to another. No immediate impact on income statement or taxes because it's not a sale or expense yet.\n\nWait, the tax rate is mentioned, but since this is a purchase of inventory, it doesn't affect taxable income right away. The tax rate might be a red herring here. The key point is that inventory purchases don't impact the income statement until the inventory is sold. So, the cash outflow is offset by the inventory increase. Therefore, the balance sheet would show a decrease in cash and an increase in inventory, but the total assets remain the same. The income statement isn't affected because it's not an expense; it's a capitalization of the cost into inventory.\n\nSo, the transaction doesn't change equity, liabilities, or net income. The tax rate is irrelevant here because there's no taxable event happening. The question might be trying to trick someone into thinking about taxes, but since it's a purchase of inventory, not a sale, taxes don't come into play immediately.\n\nDouble-checking: Purchasing inventory with cash affects the balance sheet (cash down, inventory up), but no effect on income statement or taxes. So the answer should state that there's no effect on the income statement or taxes, and the balance sheet shows an asset exchange.\n</think>\n\nThe transaction involves purchasing inventory with cash, which is an asset exchange. Cash decreases by $15, and inventory increases by $15. This does not affect the income statement, net income, or taxes, as inventory purchases are not expenses until sold. The 35% tax rate is irrelevant here since no taxable income is generated.\n\n<answer>:No effect on income statement or taxes; balance sheet: cash down $15, inventory up $15",

      "question": "A company records a $200 sale, receiving $100 in cash and $100 on credit. With a 35% tax rate, how do the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement each change?",
      "ground_truth": "On the income statement, pre-tax income is up by 200. With a tax rate of 35% net income is up by 130. On the cash flow statement, net income is up by 130, but 100 needs to be subtracted since it was non-cash revenue (increase in accounts receivable), so CFO is up by 30. There are no changes in CFF or CFI, so cash is up by 30. On the balance sheet cash is up by 30, accounts receivable is up by 100 and shareholders equity is up by 130 from net income or retained earnings.",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this financial question. So, the company made a $200 sale, getting $100 cash and $100 on credit. Tax rate is 35%. I need to figure out how the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement change.\n\nFirst, the sale is $200. Since it's a sale, revenue increases by $200 on the income statement. But wait, taxes are involved. The tax rate is 35%, so the tax expense would be 35% of the revenue? Wait, no, actually, the tax is calculated on the profit, but here the question doesn't mention any expenses. Hmm, maybe they're simplifying and assuming the sale is the only item, so the taxable income is $200. So tax expense would be 200 * 0.35 = $70. So net income would be 200 - 70 = $130. But wait, the question is about how each statement changes, not the net effect. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the sale is recorded as revenue. So income statement: Revenue increases by $200. Then tax expense is 35% of that revenue (assuming no other expenses), so tax expense is $70. So net income increases by $130.\n\nNow, balance sheet: Cash increases by $100 (from the cash received). Accounts receivable increases by $100 (since $100 is on credit). So total assets increase by $200. Liabilities? Not sure, but taxes payable might increase. Wait, tax expense is $70, so taxes payable would increase by $70. So liabilities increase by $70. But wait, the tax is a liability, so yes. So balance sheet: Assets up $200 (cash +100, AR +100), Liabilities up $70 (taxes payable), and equity up by net income $130. So 200 - 70 = 130, which matches equity.\n\nCash flow statement: The $100 cash received is an operating cash inflow. The $100 credit doesn't affect cash flow yet. So cash flow from operations increases by $100.\n\nWait, but the tax expense is $70, but that's a non-cash expense? No, tax expense is a liability, but the cash paid for taxes would be separate. Wait, the question says \"how do the statements change\" based on the sale. The tax expense is recorded, but the actual cash paid for taxes might not be part of this transaction. So the tax payable increases by $70, but no cash outflow yet. So for the cash flow statement, only the $100 cash received is a cash inflow. The tax expense doesn't affect cash flow here because it's a liability, not a cash payment.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue +$200, Tax Expense +$70, Net Income +$130.\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash +$100, Accounts Receivable +$100, Taxes Payable +$70, Retained Earnings +$130 (since net income increases equity).\n\nCash Flow Statement: Operating Cash Flow +$100 (from the cash received).\n\nWait, but the question is asking for how each statement changes. So for each statement, list the changes.\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue up $200, Tax Expense up $70, Net Income up $130.\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets: Cash +$100, AR +$100; Liabilities: Taxes Payable +$70; Equity: Retained Earnings +$130.\n\nCash Flow: Operating Activities +$100.\n\nBut the question might want the answer in a specific format. Let me check if I missed anything.\n\nWait, the sale is $200, so revenue is $200. Tax rate 35%, so tax expense is 35% of revenue (assuming no other expenses), so $70. So yes.\n\nAnother point: When they receive $100 cash and $100 on credit, the journal entry would be:\n\nDebit Cash 100, Debit Accounts Receivable 100, Credit Revenue 200.\n\nThen, for tax, since revenue is recognized, tax expense is 35% of 200, so:\n\nDebit Tax Expense 70, Credit Tax Payable 70.\n\nSo the income statement shows Revenue +200, Tax Expense +70, so Net Income +130.\n\nBalance sheet: Cash +100, AR +100 (assets), Tax Payable +70 (liabilities), and Retained Earnings +130 (equity).\n\nCash flow: The cash received is $100, so operating cash flow +100. The tax payable increase is a non-cash item, so it doesn't affect cash flow.\n\nSo the answer should state the changes for each statement.\n\nBut the question says \"how do the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement each change?\" So need to specify for each.\n\nBut the final answer needs to be concise in the correct financial format. Maybe list the changes as:\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue +$200, Tax Expense +$70, Net Income +$130.\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash +$100, AR +$100, Taxes Payable +$70, Retained Earnings +$130.\n\nCash Flow: Operating Cash Flow +$100.\n\nBut the problem is to present it concisely. Maybe the expected answer is to state the key changes for each.\n\nWait, the user might want the answer in a specific way. Let me check similar questions.\n\nTypically, for such questions, the answer would list the changes per statement.\n\nSo for the income statement: Revenue increases by $200, tax expense increases by $70, net income increases by $130.\n\nBalance sheet: Cash increases by $100, accounts receivable increases by $100, taxes payable increases by $70, retained earnings increases by $130.\n\nCash flow: Operating cash flow increases by $100.\n\nBut the answer needs to be concise. Maybe the key points.\n\nWait, the problem says \"how do the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement each change?\" So the answer should specify for each statement what changes.\n\nBut the final answer format must be concise. So perhaps:\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue +$200, Tax Expense +$70, Net Income +$130.\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash +$100, AR +$100, Taxes Payable +$70, Retained Earnings +$130.\n\nCash Flow: Operating +$100.\n\nBut to make it even more concise, maybe:\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue +$200, Net Income +$130.\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets +$200 (Cash +$100, AR +$100), Liabilities +$70 (Taxes Payable), Equity +$130.\n\nCash Flow: Operating +$100.\n\nBut the exact terms matter. Let's confirm.\n\nAnother check: The tax expense is $70, so taxes payable increases by $70. So liabilities up $70. Equity up by net income $130. Assets up $200 (cash 100 + AR 100). So balance sheet balances: 200 = 70 + 130.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the concise answer would be:\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue +$200, Net Income +$130.\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash +$100, AR +$100, Taxes Payable +$70, Retained Earnings +$130.\n\nCash Flow: Operating +$100.\n\nBut the user might want it in a specific format. Let me see the instructions again: \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\"\n\nPerhaps list each statement with the key changes.\n\nBut maybe the expected answer is to state the changes as:\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue increases by $200, net income increases by $130.\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash increases by $100, accounts receivable increases by $100, taxes payable increases by $70, retained earnings increases by $130.\n\nCash Flow Statement: Operating cash flow increases by $100.\n\nBut to make it concise, maybe using symbols:\n\nIncome Statement: Rev +200, NI +130\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash +100, AR +100, Tax Pay +70, RE +130\n\nCash Flow: Op +100\n\nBut the problem says \"correct financial format,\" so probably using the terms.\n\nWait, the user's example in the instructions might have a specific way, but since it's not given, I'll go with standard terms.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue +$200, Net Income +$130.\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash +$100, Accounts Receivable +$100, Taxes Payable +$70, Retained Earnings +$130.\n\nCash Flow Statement: Operating Cash Flow +$100.\n\nBut to make it even more concise, perhaps:\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue +$200, Net Income +$130.\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets +$200 (Cash +$100, AR +$100), Liabilities +$70 (Taxes Payable), Equity +$130.\n\nCash Flow: Operating +$100.\n\nBut the problem says \"concise,\" so maybe just the key changes without repeating.\n\nWait, the question might expect the answer to list the changes per statement in a specific way. Let me check if I made a mistake.\n\nWait, tax rate is 35%, so tax expense is 35% of the revenue, which is 200 * 0.35 = 70. So tax expense is 70, so net income is 200 - 70 = 130. Correct.\n\nBalance sheet: Cash up 100, AR up 100 (total assets up 200). Liabilities: Taxes Payable up 70. Equity: Retained Earnings up 130. So 200 = 70 + 130. Correct.\n\nCash flow: The cash received is 100, so operating cash flow +100. The tax payable increase is a non-cash item, so it doesn't affect cash flow. So yes, only +100.\n\nSo the answer should be as above.\n\nNow, the user wants the final answer in the format starting with <answer>: followed by the concise answer.\n\nSo the concise answer would be:\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue +$200, Net Income +$130; Balance Sheet: Cash +$100, AR +$100, Taxes Payable +$70, Retained Earnings +$130; Cash Flow: Operating +$100.\n\nBut to make it even shorter, maybe:\n\nIncome Statement: Rev +$200, NI +$130; Balance Sheet: Cash +$100, AR +$100, Tax Pay +$70, RE +$130; Cash Flow: Op +$100.\n\nBut using full terms is better.\n\nWait, the problem says \"in the correct financial format,\" so using standard terms like \"Accounts Receivable\" not \"AR,\" etc.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue +$200, Net Income +$130.\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash +$100, Accounts Receivable +$100, Taxes Payable +$70, Retained Earnings +$130.\n\nCash Flow Statement: Operating Cash Flow +$100.\n\nBut to fit in a single line as per the instruction's \"concise,\" maybe separate with semicolons.\n\nSo:\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue +$200, Net Income +$130; Balance Sheet: Cash +$100, Accounts Receivable +$100, Taxes Payable +$70, Retained Earnings +$130; Cash Flow: Operating +$100.\n\nYes, that's concise.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:Income Statement: Revenue +$200, Net Income +$130; Balance Sheet: Cash +$100, Accounts Receivable +$100, Taxes Payable +$70, Retained Earnings +$130; Cash Flow: Operating +$100",

Goodwill impairment could hit net income later. Need to mention that.\n\nBalance sheet is where it gets interesting. Assets and liabilities get consolidated, and goodwill appears as an asset. The debt structure might change too if the acquiring company takes on new debt. \n\nCash flow statement... ah yes, the merger itself is an investing activity (cash outflow), but future operational cash flows will reflect the combined entity. Should clarify that the actual merger payment is a cash outflow in investing section.\n\nWait, the user emphasized \"concise\" in the instructions. I'll keep each point to one sentence max. No need for examples or deep dives into accounting standards.\n\n*checks instructions again* Must end with exactly \"<answer>: [conclusion]\" on new line. No fluff. The conclusion should tie all three statements together in one tight sentence.\n\n*mental note* Don't confuse merger with acquisition - here it's a merger so both companies combine, not one buying the other. But for financial statement impact, the accounting treatment is similar.\n\n*double-checking* Yep, the core impacts are: \n- Income: combined revenue + integration costs \n- Balance sheet: consolidated assets/liabilities + goodwill \n- Cash flow: merger payment as investing outflow\n\nFinal answer should mirror this concisely. \"Merger consolidates revenues/expenses on income statement, combines assets/liabilities with goodwill on balance sheet, and records merger payment as investing cash outflow on cash flow statement.\"\n\n*verifying* That covers all three without exceeding 25 words. Perfect for \"concise\" requirement.\n</think>\n\nA merger consolidates the acquiring and target company's financials. The income statement combines revenues and expenses, adding integration costs and potential goodwill impairment. The balance sheet reflects combined assets/liabilities, with goodwill recorded as an asset. The cash flow statement shows the merger payment as an investing cash outflow.\n\n<answer>: Income statement: combined revenues/expenses; Balance sheet: consolidated assets/liabilities with goodwill; Cash flow: merger payment as investing outflow",

      "question": "How are the three statement are affected when a company buys $300 of inventory by issuing new debt?",
      "ground_truth": "There is no immediate impact on the income statement since revenue has yet to be recognized at this point. On the Cash flow statement, cash flow from operations is down by $300 for the increase in inventory. The issuance of debt reduces cash flow from financing by $300 leaving net cash unchanged. On the balance sheet, inventory increases assets by $300 and debt increases the liabilities by $300.",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the scenario is a company buying $300 of inventory by issuing new debt. I need to figure out how this affects the three financial statements: income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.\n\nFirst, let's break down the transaction. The company is purchasing inventory, which is an asset. But they're not paying cash; instead, they're issuing new debt. So, they're taking on a liability (debt) to acquire the inventory.\n\nStarting with the balance sheet. Inventory is an asset, so it increases by $300. The debt (liability) also increases by $300. So, assets up $300, liabilities up $300. The balance sheet remains balanced.\n\nNow, the income statement. Inventory purchases don't affect the income statement directly unless there's a cost of goods sold or something. But here, they're just buying inventory, so no expense is recognized yet. So, the income statement isn't affected. The purchase of inventory is a capital expenditure, not an expense, so no impact on revenue or expenses.\n\nCash flow statement. Since they issued debt, that's a financing activity. The cash flow from financing activities would increase by $300 (because they received cash from the debt). But wait, they used that cash to buy inventory. Wait, no. Wait, if they issue debt, they get cash. Then they use that cash to buy inventory. But inventory is an asset, so the cash decreases by $300, and inventory increases by $300. So, the cash flow from operating activities might not be affected because inventory is a current asset, but the cash used to buy it would be an operating activity? Wait, no. When you buy inventory, it's an operating activity. But in this case, the company is using the cash from the debt to buy inventory. So, the cash flow from financing (debt issuance) would be +$300, and then the cash used to buy inventory would be -300 in operating activities. But wait, the question says \"buying inventory by issuing new debt.\" So, the company issues debt (so they get cash), and then uses that cash to buy inventory. So, the cash inflow from financing is +300, and the cash outflow for inventory purchase is -300 in operating activities. But the net effect on cash is zero. However, the question is about how the three statements are affected. So, for the cash flow statement, the financing section would show +300, and operating section would show -300. But the question might be simplified. Wait, but the main point is that the cash flow from operations would decrease by 300 (since buying inventory is an operating use of cash), and financing would increase by 300. But the net cash flow is zero. However, the question might just want to know the immediate effects on each statement.\n\nWait, but the key point is that the inventory purchase is an asset, so balance sheet: assets up, liabilities up. Income statement: no effect. Cash flow: operating cash outflow of 300, financing cash inflow of 300. But the question is phrased as \"how are the three statements affected,\" so I need to state for each.\n\nWait, but the standard answer for such questions usually is:\n\n- Balance Sheet: Assets (Inventory) +300, Liabilities (Debt) +300.\n\n- Income Statement: No effect.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Operating Activities -300 (since buying inventory is an operating use), Financing Activities +300 (from debt issuance).\n\nBut sometimes, the cash flow from operations might not be affected if the inventory purchase is considered a non-cash transaction, but no, buying inventory with cash is an operating activity. Wait, but in this case, the company issued debt (so got cash) and then used that cash to buy inventory. So, the cash flow from financing is +300, and cash flow from operations is -300. So, the cash flow statement would show both.\n\nBut the question is probably expecting the standard answer. Let me confirm.\n\nAnother way: When you buy inventory with cash, it's an operating activity. But here, the cash came from debt, so the financing activity is the source. So, the cash flow statement would have a +300 in financing and -300 in operating. But the net cash flow is zero, but the individual sections are affected.\n\nBut the question is about how the three statements are affected. So, for each statement:\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets (Inventory) increase by 300, Liabilities (Debt) increase by 300.\n\nIncome Statement: No effect.\n\nCash Flow Statement: Operating Activities decrease by 300 (cash outflow), Financing Activities increase by 300 (cash inflow).\n\nBut the question might want a concise answer. Let me check standard textbook answers.\n\nTypically, for buying inventory with cash: balance sheet, inventory up, cash down. But here, it's buying with debt, so cash is not down because they got cash from debt. Wait, no. Wait, if they issue debt, they receive cash. Then they use that cash to buy inventory. So, cash remains the same (received 300, spent 300), but inventory increases by 300, and debt increases by 300.\n\nSo, balance sheet: Inventory +300, Debt +300. Cash is unchanged.\n\nIncome statement: No effect.\n\nCash flow: Financing +300 (debt issuance), Operating -300 (inventory purchase). So, the cash flow statement would show both.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"how are the three statements affected,\" so the answer should state for each.\n\nBut the user wants the final answer in a specific format. The instructions say to provide the final answer concisely in the correct financial format.\n\nSo, the standard answer would be:\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets (Inventory) +$300, Liabilities (Debt) +$300.\n\nIncome Statement: No effect.\n\nCash Flow Statement: Operating Activities -$300, Financing Activities +$300.\n\nBut to make it concise, perhaps:\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets ↑, Liabilities ↑; Income Statement: No effect; Cash Flow: Operating ↓, Financing ↑.\n\nBut the user might want specific terms. Let me check.\n\nAnother way: The three statements are affected as follows:\n\n- Balance Sheet: Inventory (asset) increases by $300, Debt (liability) increases by $300.\n\n- Income Statement: No effect.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Cash from operations decreases by $300, cash from financing increases by $300.\n\nBut the question says \"the three statement are affected,\" so the answer should list each.\n\nBut the user wants the final answer in a concise format. So, perhaps:\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets +300, Liabilities +300; Income Statement: No effect; Cash Flow: Operating -300, Financing +300.\n\nBut need to make sure it's correct.\n\nWait, when you buy inventory with cash, it's an operating activity. But here, the cash came from debt, so the financing activity is the source. So, the cash flow statement would have a financing inflow of 300 and an operating outflow of 300. So, yes.\n\nSo, the answer should state that for the balance sheet, assets and liabilities both increase by 300. Income statement no effect. Cash flow: operating outflow 300, financing inflow 300.\n\nSo, the concise answer would be:\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets ↑ $300, Liabilities ↑ $300; Income Statement: No effect; Cash Flow: Operating ↓ $300, Financing ↑ $300.\n\nBut the user might want it in a specific format. Let me check the instructions again. The final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets +300, Liabilities +300; Income Statement: No effect; Cash Flow: Operating -300, Financing +300.\n\nYes, that's standard.\n\nSo, the final answer should be that.\n</think>\n\nBalance Sheet: Assets +300, Liabilities +300; Income Statement: No effect; Cash Flow: Operating -300, Financing +300\n\n<answer>:Balance Sheet: Assets +300, Liabilities +300; Income Statement: No effect; Cash Flow: Operating -300, Financing +300",

      "question": "Describe the outcome of a $100 increase in depreciation on the three financial statements, assuming an 12% tax rate.",
      "ground_truth": "On the income statement, pre-tax income is down by 100, net income is down by 88 (100 * (1 - 0.12)). On the cash flow statement, net income is down by 88 and 100 is added back since depreciation is a non-cash expense. Cash is up by 12. On the balance sheet, cash is up by 12, PP&E is down by 100, so assets are down by 88. This matches with liabilities + equities, as retained earnings is down by 88, which is a part of shareholders equity,.",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about the impact of a $100 increase in depreciation on the three financial statements with a 12% tax rate. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how depreciation affects each statement. Depreciation is an expense on the income statement. So, a $100 increase in depreciation would reduce pre-tax income by $100. \n\nNext, considering the tax rate of 12%, the tax savings would be 12% of $100, which is $12. So, net income would decrease by $100 minus $12, which is $88. \n\nNow, for the cash flow statement: Depreciation is added back to net income in the operating activities section because it's a non-cash expense. So, the $100 increase in depreciation would increase cash flow from operations by $100. But wait, the tax effect is already accounted for in the net income. So, the cash flow impact is just the $100 addition, but the tax savings would mean that the tax expense is lower, so the cash flow from operations would be higher by $100 (since depreciation is added back, and the tax savings are already reflected in the lower tax expense). Hmm, maybe I should think of it as: the $100 depreciation reduces taxable income by $100, so tax expense decreases by $12, meaning cash paid for taxes is $12 less. But in the cash flow statement, the operating cash flow would be net income + depreciation - change in working capital. So, net income decreases by $88, but depreciation increases by $100, so the net effect on operating cash flow is +$12? Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nOriginal net income: let's say it was X. After $100 depreciation increase, pre-tax income is X - $100. Tax is 12% of (X - $100), so tax expense is 0.12*(X - 100). But the tax saved is 12% of $100, so tax expense decreases by $12. Therefore, net income is (X - $100) - (tax expense decrease) = X - $100 + $12 = X - $88. So net income decreases by $88.\n\nFor the cash flow statement: operating cash flow = net income + non-cash expenses (like depreciation). So, the increase in depreciation by $100 means we add back $100 more. But since net income decreased by $88, the operating cash flow would be (net income - $88) + ($100) = net income + $12. Wait, no. Let's say original operating cash flow was (net income) + depreciation. If depreciation increases by $100, then the new operating cash flow is (net income - $88) + (depreciation + $100) = (net income + depreciation) + $12. So, operating cash flow increases by $12. But I think the standard way is that the increase in depreciation expense leads to a $100 increase in operating cash flow (since it's added back), but the tax effect is already considered in the net income. Wait, maybe the tax effect is separate. Let me check a reference.\n\nActually, when depreciation increases by $100, it reduces taxable income by $100, so tax expense decreases by $12 (12% of 100). Therefore, net income decreases by $88 ($100 - $12). On the cash flow statement, operating cash flow is net income + depreciation (since depreciation is a non-cash expense). So, the change in operating cash flow would be: the decrease in net income by $88 plus the increase in depreciation by $100, so net +$12. Wait, but depreciation is added back, so the $100 increase in depreciation would add $100 to operating cash flow, but the net income is lower by $88, so the total effect is +$12. But I think the standard answer is that operating cash flow increases by $100 (the depreciation amount) because the tax effect is already accounted for in the net income. Wait, no. Let's think of it as:\n\n- Income Statement: Depreciation up $100 → EBIT down $100 → Tax down $12 (12% of 100) → Net Income down $88.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Operating cash flow = Net Income + Depreciation. So, Net Income down $88, Depreciation up $100 → Operating cash flow up $12.\n\n- Balance Sheet: Accumulated Depreciation (a contra asset) increases by $100, so total assets decrease by $100. Retained earnings (part of equity) decrease by $88 (since net income decreased by $88), so equity decreases by $88. But the cash flow from operations increased by $12, so cash increases by $12. Wait, but the balance sheet must balance. Let's see:\n\n- Assets: Cash increases by $12 (from operating cash flow), Accumulated Depreciation increases by $100 (so net fixed assets decrease by $100). So total assets: +$12 (cash) - $100 (net fixed assets) = -$88.\n\n- Liabilities and Equity: Retained earnings decrease by $88 (since net income decreased by $88), so equity decreases by $88. So assets decrease by $88, equity decreases by $88. That balances.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Income Statement: Net Income decreases by $88.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Operating Cash Flow increases by $12 (since net income down $88, depreciation up $100 → net +$12).\n\n- Balance Sheet: Cash increases by $12, Accumulated Depreciation increases by $100 (so net fixed assets decrease by $100), Retained Earnings decrease by $88.\n\nBut the question asks for the outcome on the three financial statements. So, the key points are:\n\n- Income Statement: Net Income ↓ $88\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Operating Cash Flow ↑ $12\n\n- Balance Sheet: Cash ↑ $12, Accumulated Depreciation ↑ $100 (so Net Fixed Assets ↓ $100), Retained Earnings ↓ $88\n\nBut the question might expect the main effects. Typically, for such questions, the standard answer is:\n\n- Income Statement: Net income decreases by $88 (after tax)\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Operating cash flow increases by $100 (but wait, no, because the tax effect is already considered. Wait, no, the tax effect is part of the income statement. The cash flow impact is the depreciation amount plus the tax savings. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me check a standard example. If depreciation increases by $100, tax rate 30%, then:\n\n- Income: EBIT down $100, tax down $30, net income down $70.\n\n- Cash flow: Operating cash flow = net income + depreciation = (down $70) + $100 = up $30.\n\n- Balance sheet: Cash up $30, accumulated depreciation up $100, retained earnings down $70.\n\nSo in this case, with 12% tax rate:\n\n- Net income decrease: $100 * (1 - 0.12) = $88.\n\n- Operating cash flow increase: $100 * (1 - 0.12) = $88? Wait, no. Wait, operating cash flow is net income + depreciation. So net income is down $88, depreciation is up $100, so total operating cash flow change is (-88) + 100 = +12. So $12 increase.\n\nBut in the example I thought of earlier with 30% tax, it's $100 * (1 - 0.3) = $70 net income decrease, and operating cash flow increase is $30 (which is the tax savings). Wait, $100 depreciation increase leads to $30 tax savings, so operating cash flow increases by $30. Wait, that's another way to see it: the tax savings is $30, so cash flow from operations increases by $30. But according to the other calculation, it's $100 (depreciation) - $70 (net income decrease) = $30. Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nOriginal net income: let's say before the depreciation increase, net income was NI.\n\nAfter depreciation increase of $100:\n\n- Pre-tax income: NI + $100 (wait, no, depreciation is an expense, so it's subtracted. So if depreciation increases by $100, pre-tax income decreases by $100. So new pre-tax income = old pre-tax - $100.\n\nTax expense = 30% of (old pre-tax - $100) = old tax - $30.\n\nNet income = (old pre-tax - $100) - (old tax - $30) = old net income - $70.\n\nSo net income down $70.\n\nOperating cash flow = net income + depreciation.\n\nOld operating cash flow = old net income + old depreciation.\n\nNew operating cash flow = (old net income - $70) + (old depreciation + $100) = old operating cash flow + $30.\n\nSo operating cash flow increases by $30, which is the tax savings ($100 * 30% = $30).\n\nAh, so the operating cash flow increase is equal to the tax savings, which is depreciation * tax rate. Wait, no: tax savings is depreciation * tax rate, so $100 * 0.3 = $30, which matches the operating cash flow increase.\n\nIn the 12% case, tax savings = $100 * 0.12 = $12, so operating cash flow increases by $12.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the operating cash flow increase is equal to the tax savings, which is depreciation * tax rate.\n\nSo for the 12% tax rate:\n\n- Income Statement: Net Income decreases by $100 - $12 = $88.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Operating Cash Flow increases by $12 (the tax savings).\n\n- Balance Sheet: Cash increases by $12, Accumulated Depreciation increases by $100 (so Net Fixed Assets decrease by $100), Retained Earnings decrease by $88.\n\nSo the three statements:\n\n- Income Statement: Net Income ↓ $88\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Operating Cash Flow ↑ $12\n\n- Balance Sheet: Cash ↑ $12, Accumulated Depreciation ↑ $100, Retained Earnings ↓ $88\n\nBut the question asks to \"describe the outcome\", so probably the key changes.\n\nThe standard way to present this is:\n\n- Income Statement: Net income decreases by $88.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Operating cash flow increases by $12.\n\n- Balance Sheet: Cash increases by $12, accumulated depreciation increases by $100 (net fixed assets decrease by $100), retained earnings decrease by $88.\n\nBut the question might expect the concise answer for each statement.\n\nSo the final answer should list the three effects.\n\nBut the user says \"provide the final answer in the required format\", which is concise in financial format.\n\nLooking at the instructions, the answer should be concise, in correct financial format.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nIncome Statement: Net Income - $88\n\nCash Flow: Operating Cash Flow + $12\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash + $12, Accumulated Depreciation + $100, Retained Earnings - $88\n\nBut maybe they want it in a specific way. Let me check common answers.\n\nTypically, for such questions, the answer is:\n\n- Income Statement: Net income decreases by $88.\n\n- Cash Flow Statement: Operating cash flow increases by $12.\n\n- Balance Sheet: Cash increases by $12, Accumulated Depreciation increases by $100, Retained Earnings decrease by $88.\n\nBut to make it concise, perhaps:\n\nNet Income: -$88; Operating Cash Flow: +$12; Cash: +$12, Accumulated Depreciation: +$100, Retained Earnings: -$88.\n\nBut the user might want it in a specific format.

Dep. +$100, Ret. Earnings -$88\n\nBut I think the standard way is to list each statement's effect.\n\nWait, the question says \"describe the outcome\", so the answer should state the effect on each of the three statements.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nIncome Statement: Net income decreases by $88.\n\nCash Flow Statement: Operating cash flow increases by $12.\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash increases by $12, accumulated depreciation increases by $100, retained earnings decrease by $88.\n\nBut the user wants it concise.

Dep. +$100, Ret.

PIK stands for \"Payment In Kind,\" meaning the interest isn't paid in cash but added to the principal. So, instead of paying cash interest, the debt balance increases by the interest amount each period.\n\nThe firm has 200 PIK debt at 10% interest. So the annual interest expense would be 200 * 10% = 20. Since it's PIK, this 20 isn't paid out; it's added to the debt. So the debt balance on the balance sheet will increase by 20 each year.\n\nNow, for the income statement: The interest expense is 20. But since it's PIK, there's no cash outflow, but the expense still reduces net income. However, because the interest is tax-deductible, the tax savings would be 20 * 35% = 7. So the net effect on net income would be 20 - 7 = 13 reduction. Wait, actually, the interest expense is 20, which reduces taxable income by 20, so tax savings are 20 * 0.35 = 7. So net income decreases by 20 - 7 = 13? Wait, no. Let me think again. The interest expense is 20, so taxable income is reduced by 20, so tax expense is reduced by 20 * 0.35 = 7. So the net income impact is -20 (interest) + 7 (tax savings) = -13. So net income decreases by 13.\n\nBut for the cash flow statement, since the interest is PIK, there's no cash outflow for interest. So the operating cash flow would be higher by the amount of interest that would have been paid, but since it's PIK, it's not paid. Wait, no. The interest expense is still recorded, but since it's not paid in cash, the cash flow from operations would not have a cash outflow for interest. So the cash flow from operations would be adjusted by adding back the interest expense (since it's a non-cash expense), but wait, in the cash flow statement, interest paid is usually in operating activities. But since it's PIK, no cash is paid, so the interest expense doesn't affect cash flow. So the cash flow from operations would not have a deduction for interest, so it's as if the interest expense didn't reduce cash flow. Wait, but the interest expense is a non-cash item, so when calculating cash flow from operations, you start with net income and add back non-cash expenses like interest. Wait, no. Typically, interest expense is a non-cash expense, so when you go from net income to operating cash flow, you add back interest expense. But in this case, since it's PIK, the interest expense is still recorded, but no cash is paid. So the operating cash flow would include adding back the interest expense (20), but since it's PIK, the actual cash outflow for interest is zero. So the operating cash flow would be higher by 20 compared to if it were cash interest.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Normally, for cash interest, you have interest expense on the income statement, and then in cash flow, you have a cash outflow for interest. But for PIK, the interest expense is still on the income statement, but no cash is paid, so the cash flow from operations would not have that outflow. So the cash flow from operations would be net income plus interest expense (since it's a non-cash expense), but since it's PIK, the interest expense is not paid, so it's added back. Wait, but in standard cash flow, you add back interest expense to net income to get operating cash flow. So for PIK, the interest expense is still added back, but since no cash was paid, the cash flow from operations would be higher by the amount of interest. Wait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose net income is X. Interest expense is 20 (PIK). So operating cash flow = X + 20 (since interest expense is non-cash). If it were cash interest, operating cash flow would be X + 20 (add back interest) minus 20 (cash paid), so net effect zero. Wait, no. Wait, the standard way: net income includes interest expense, so to get operating cash flow, you add back interest expense (because it's a non-cash expense). But if interest is paid in cash, then you have a cash outflow in operating activities. So for cash interest, operating cash flow = net income + interest expense - cash paid for interest. But since cash paid for interest is equal to interest expense, it would be net income + interest expense - interest expense = net income. Wait, that's not right. Let me recall the correct method.\n\nActually, the cash flow statement's operating section starts with net income, then adjusts for non-cash items (like adding back depreciation, interest expense, etc.), and changes in working capital. Interest expense is a non-cash item, so it's added back. However, the actual cash paid for interest is a separate line. Wait, no. In the cash flow statement, interest paid is typically included in operating activities. So if interest is paid in cash, it's a cash outflow. If it's PIK, no cash is paid, so no outflow. So for the cash flow statement, the interest expense is added back to net income (as a non-cash expense), but since no cash was paid, there's no deduction for interest paid. So the operating cash flow would be net income + interest expense (since it's non-cash) and no deduction for interest paid. Wait, but in reality, the standard adjustment is to add back interest expense (as it's non-cash) and then subtract the cash paid for interest. But if cash paid is zero (PIK), then it's net income + interest expense - 0 = net income + interest expense.\n\nBut let's get back to the question. The user is asking how it flows through the three statements.\n\nBalance sheet: PIK debt increases by the interest amount. So the debt balance goes from 200 to 220 (200 + 20). So the liability increases by 20.\n\nIncome statement: Interest expense of 20, which reduces net income. Tax savings of 7 (20 * 35%), so net income decreases by 13 (20 - 7).\n\nCash flow statement: Operating cash flow increases by 20 (since interest expense is added back, and no cash paid). So cash flow from operations is higher by 20 compared to if it were cash interest. But the question is about the flow, so the key points are:\n\n- Balance sheet: Debt increases by 20 (to 220)\n- Income statement: Interest expense 20, tax savings 7, net income down 13\n- Cash flow: Operating cash flow up by 20 (since no cash outflow for interest)\n\nWait, but the cash flow statement's operating section would have the interest expense added back, so the cash flow from operations would be higher by the interest amount. So the cash flow statement shows an increase in operating cash flow of 20.\n\nNow, the question is to state how it flows through each statement. The answer should be concise, so perhaps listing the effects.\n\nBut the user wants the final answer in a specific format. Let me check the instructions again. The final answer must be concise, in correct financial format.\n\nSo for the balance sheet: PIK debt increases by 20 (200 + 20 = 220).\n\nIncome statement: Interest expense of 20, tax benefit of 7, net income decrease of 13.\n\nCash flow: Operating cash flow increases by 20 (no cash interest paid).\n\nBut the question says \"how will this flow through\", so the answer should summarize the impact on each statement.\n\nBut the user might expect a specific format. Let me see if there's a standard way to present this.\n\nTypically, for such questions, the answer would state:\n\n- Balance Sheet: PIK debt increases by $20 (to $220)\n- Income Statement: Interest expense $20, tax savings $7, net income decrease $13\n- Cash Flow: Operating cash flow increases by $20 (no cash interest paid)\n\nBut the user wants the final answer in a concise format. The instructions say \"concise, in the correct financial format\".\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nBalance Sheet: Debt +$20 (to $220)\nIncome Statement: Interest expense $20, net income -$13\nCash Flow: Operating cash flow +$20\n\nBut need to check if the numbers are correct.\n\nInterest expense: 200 * 10% = 20.\n\nTax rate 35%, so tax savings = 20 * 0.35 = 7.\n\nNet income impact: -20 +7 = -13.\n\nCash flow: Since no cash paid, operating cash flow is higher by 20 (as interest expense is added back).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the final answer should be a concise statement of these points.\n\nThe user's example in the instructions says to end with <answer>: followed by the answer.\n\nSo the answer should be something like:\n\nBalance Sheet: PIK debt increases by $20. Income Statement: Interest expense $20, net income decrease $13. Cash Flow: Operating cash flow increases by $20.\n\nBut need to make sure it's concise. Maybe using symbols.\n\nBut the user says \"correct financial format\", so perhaps using standard terms.\n\nAnother way: The PIK interest of $20 increases debt by $20 on the balance sheet, reduces net income by $13 ($20 - $7 tax shield) on the income statement, and increases operating cash flow by $20 on the cash flow statement.\n\nBut to be concise, perhaps:\n\nBalance Sheet: Debt +$20. Income Statement: Interest expense $20, net income -$13. Cash Flow: OCF +$20.\n\nBut the user might want it in a specific way. Let's check the numbers again.\n\nDebt: 200 PIK at 10% interest. So interest is 20, added to debt. So balance sheet liability increases by 20.\n\nIncome statement: Interest expense 20, tax rate 35%, so tax savings 7, so net income impact is -20 +7 = -13.\n\nCash flow: Since no cash paid, operating cash flow is higher by 20 (as interest expense is non-cash, so added back).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer should state these three points concisely.\n\nThe user's example in the instructions says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\".\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nBalance Sheet: PIK debt increases by $20. Income Statement: Interest expense $20, net income decrease $13. Cash Flow: Operating cash flow increases by $20.\n\nBut to make it even more concise, maybe using symbols:\n\nBS: Debt +$20; IS: Int exp $20, NI -$13; CF: OCF +$20\n\nBut the user might prefer full terms. Let's see.\n\nIn financial contexts, it's common to use abbreviations like BS, IS, CF.\n\nBut the question says \"correct financial format\", so perhaps using the full terms.\n\nBut the user's example in the instructions doesn't specify, so I'll go with the full terms.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\nBalance Sheet: PIK debt increases by $20. Income Statement: Interest expense $20, net income decrease $13. Cash Flow: Operating cash flow increases by $20.\n\nBut let's check if the numbers are correct.\n\nInterest: 200 * 10% = 20. Correct.\n\nTax savings: 20 * 35% = 7. So net income impact: 20 - 7 = 13 decrease. Correct.\n\nCash flow: Since no cash paid, operating cash flow is higher by 20. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer should be as above.\n</think>\n\nBalance Sheet: PIK debt increases by $20 (to $220).  \nIncome Statement: Interest expense $20, net income decrease $13.  \nCash Flow: Operating cash flow increases by $20.  \n\n<answer>:Balance Sheet: Debt +$20; Income Statement: Int exp $20, NI -$13; Cash Flow: OCF +$20",

      "question": "A business sells of an asset with a carrying value of 50 for 75. Assume a 25% tax rate. How does this affect the financial statements?",
      "ground_truth": "On the income statement, a gain on sale increases net income by $25 * (1-0.25) = $18.75. On the cash flow statement, net income in CFO is increased by $18.75, however we subtract the non-cash $25 gain on sale, leaving CFO down by $6.25. Sale of asset increases cash flow from investing by $75, resulting in a net cash increase of $68.75. On the balance sheet, cash increases by $68.75 and PPE is decreased by $50, leaving assets up by $18.75. Shareholders equity is increased by $18.75 from the increase in net income.",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this financial question. So, the business is selling an asset with a carrying value of 50 for 75. There's a 25% tax rate. I need to figure out how this affects the financial statements.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you sell an asset for more than its carrying value, you have a gain. The carrying value is the book value, which is 50 here. The sale price is 75, so the gain should be 75 minus 50, which is 25. \n\nBut wait, there's a tax rate involved. The gain is taxable, so they'll have to pay taxes on that 25. At 25%, the tax would be 25 * 0.25 = 6.25. So the net gain after tax would be 25 - 6.25 = 18.75.\n\nNow, how does this affect the financial statements? The income statement will show the gain from the sale. The gain before tax is 25, but after tax, it's 18.75. So the income statement will have an increase in income by 18.75. \n\nOn the balance sheet, the asset (like property, plant, or equipment) is removed. The cash increases by 75 (since they sold it for 75). The carrying value was 50, so removing that asset would reduce the asset side by 50. But since they received 75, the net effect on assets is +25 (75 cash - 50 asset). However, the tax effect: the tax payable would be 6.25, so cash would be reduced by that tax, but wait, the tax is paid later, so maybe it's a liability. Wait, no, the tax expense is recognized, so the income statement shows the tax expense, which affects net income. The cash flow from operating activities would include the tax paid, but the question is about the financial statements in general, not cash flow.\n\nWait, the main points are: the gain on sale is 25, tax expense is 6.25, so net gain is 18.75. So the income statement shows a 18.75 increase in net income. The balance sheet: cash increases by 75 (from the sale), the asset is removed (so asset decreases by 50), so net asset change is +25. But then, the tax payable would increase by 6.25, so liabilities increase by 6.25. Wait, but the tax is calculated on the gain, so the tax expense is 6.25, which would be a liability unless paid immediately. But the question doesn't specify when the tax is paid, so we assume it's accrued. So the balance sheet would have cash up 75, asset down 50, so net cash increase 25, but tax payable up 6.25, so net cash effect is 75 - 6.25 = 68.75? Wait, no. Let's break it down.\n\nWhen the sale happens:\n- Debit Cash 75\n- Credit Asset (carrying value) 50\n- Credit Gain on Sale 25\n\nThen, tax on the gain: 25 * 25% = 6.25. So:\n- Debit Tax Expense 6.25\n- Credit Tax Payable 6.25\n\nSo the income statement shows a gain of 25, but tax expense of 6.25, so net income increases by 18.75.\n\nOn the balance sheet:\n- Cash increases by 75 (from sale)\n- Asset decreases by 50 (removed)\n- Tax Payable increases by 6.25 (liability)\n- Retained Earnings (equity) increases by 18.75 (from net income)\n\nSo the net effect on assets: Cash +75, Asset -50, so net +25. Liabilities +6.25, Equity +18.75. So 25 = 6.25 + 18.75. That balances.\n\nBut the question is asking \"how does this affect the financial statements?\" So the main points are the gain on sale, tax impact, leading to increased net income and changes in assets and liabilities.\n\nBut the answer needs to be concise in financial format. The key is the net gain after tax, which is 18.75. So the income statement shows a $18.75 increase in net income. The balance sheet shows cash up $75, asset down $50, tax payable up $6.25, and equity up $18.75.\n\nBut the question might just want the net effect on income, or the gain after tax. Let me check standard accounting treatment.\n\nThe gain on sale is 25, tax is 6.25, so net gain is 18.75. So the income statement will reflect a $18.75 increase in net income. The balance sheet will have cash increased by 75, asset decreased by 50, so net cash effect is +25, but tax payable increases by 6.25, so the net cash flow from the sale is 75 - 6.25 = 68.75? Wait, no. The tax is a separate expense. The cash received is 75, and the tax is paid later, so cash is +75, but tax payable is +6.25, so the net cash flow from the transaction is 75, but the tax is a liability. However, the question is about the effect on financial statements, not cash flow.\n\nThe main answer they're looking for is probably the net gain after tax, which is 18.75. So the income statement increases by 18.75, and the balance sheet reflects the changes as above.\n\nBut the question says \"how does this affect the financial statements?\" So the answer should state the impact. But the instructions say to provide the final answer in concise financial format. Maybe they want the amount of the gain after tax, which is 18.75.\n\nWait, let me confirm the calculation. Carrying value 50, sold for 75, so gain is 25. Tax rate 25%, so tax on gain is 6.25. So net gain is 25 - 6.25 = 18.75. Yes.\n\nSo the effect is a $18.75 increase in net income, which affects the income statement and retained earnings on the balance sheet.\n\nThe answer should be the net gain after tax, so 18.75. But how to format it? Probably as a number, maybe with a dollar sign. But the question says \"in the correct financial format\". So likely $18.75.\n\nWait, but the question might expect the answer to state the effect, but the instructions say \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\". So probably just the amount, like $18.75.\n\nWait, let me check similar questions. Usually, when asked how it affects, the key number is the net gain. So the answer is a $18.75 increase in net income.\n\nBut the problem says \"provide the final answer in the required format\", which is to have the answer start with <answer>: followed by the answer. So the answer should be $18.75.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The gain before tax is 25, tax is 6.25, so net gain is 18.75. So the income statement shows +18.75, which is the key effect. So the answer is $18.75.\n\nYes, that's the standard way to present it. So the final answer is $18.75.\n</think>\n\n<answer>18.75</answer>",

It later sold those goods for $600, incurred $150 in operating expenses, paid 6% interest on the loan, and repaid 12% of the original principal.

Pre-tax income is 150 - 36 = 114. Post-tax income is 114 * 0.9 or 102.6. On the cash flow statement net income is up 102.6 and you add back 300 since inventory went down (and was a non-cash expense), 12% of principal is paid back or .12 * 300 = 36, so cash is up by 102.6 + 300 - 36 = 366.6.

Liabilities +Equity = -36 + 102.6 = 66.6. Balance sheet balances.",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this financial problem step by step. The question is about how a firm's financial statements are affected after borrowing money, buying goods, selling them, incurring expenses, paying interest, and repaying part of the principal. The tax rate is 10%. I need to figure out the impacts on the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the transactions:\n\n- Borrowed $300 (so cash increases by $300, and a liability like a loan increases by $300).\n- Bought goods for $300 (so inventory increases by $300, but since they borrowed to buy, maybe the cash was used immediately? Wait, the problem says \"borrowed $300 to buy goods,\" so the cash from the loan is used to purchase the goods. So cash goes up by $300 (from the loan), then immediately spent to buy goods, so cash would be back to zero? Wait, no. When you borrow, you get cash. So borrowing $300: cash +$300, loan liability +$300. Then using that cash to buy goods: cash -$300, inventory +$300. So net effect on cash is zero, but inventory is $300.\n\nThen they sold the goods for $600. So revenue is $600. Cost of goods sold (COGS) would be the $300 they spent to buy the goods. So gross profit is $600 - $300 = $300.\n\nOperating expenses are $150. So operating income would be $300 - $150 = $150.\n\nInterest on the loan: 6% of $300. So 0.06 * 300 = $18. So interest expense is $18.\n\nThen they repaid 12% of the original principal. Original principal is $300, so 12% of that is 0.12 * 300 = $36. So they pay back $36 of the loan. So the loan liability decreases by $36.\n\nTax rate is 10%. So taxable income is operating income minus interest expense? Wait, no. Let's see: the income statement would have revenue, COGS, operating expenses, interest expense, then tax.\n\nWait, the order is: Revenue - COGS = Gross Profit. Gross Profit - Operating Expenses = Operating Income. Operating Income - Interest Expense = EBIT. Then EBIT - Interest = EBT (Earnings Before Tax), then tax, then net income.\n\nWait, but interest is an expense, so it's subtracted after operating income. So:\n\nRevenue: $600\n\nCOGS: $300\n\nGross Profit: $300\n\nOperating Expenses: $150\n\nOperating Income: $150\n\nInterest Expense: $18\n\nEBT (Earnings Before Tax): $150 - $18 = $132\n\nTax: 10% of $132 = $13.20\n\nNet Income: $132 - $13.20 = $118.80\n\nNow, let's check the balance sheet effects.\n\nAssets:\n\n- Cash: Initially, borrowed $300 (cash +$300), then spent $300 on goods (cash -$300), so cash was zero. Then sold goods for $600: cash +$600. Then paid operating expenses $150: cash -$150. Paid interest $18: cash -$18. Repaid loan $36: cash -$36. So total cash flow:\n\nStart with $0 (after buying goods), then +$600 from sales, -$150 (opex), -$18 (interest), -$36 (loan repayment). So cash = 600 - 150 -18 -36 = 600 - 204 = $396.\n\nWait, but the initial borrowing: when they borrowed $300, cash went up by $300, then they used that $300 to buy goods, so cash went back to zero. Then they sold goods for $600, so cash +$600. Then they paid $150 opex, so cash -$150. Paid interest $18, cash -$18. Repaid $36 principal, cash -$36. So total cash: 600 -150 -18 -36 = 396. So cash is $396.\n\nInventory: They bought goods for $300, sold them, so inventory is now $0.\n\nLiabilities:\n\n- Loan: Initially $300. Repaid $36, so remaining loan is $300 - $36 = $264.\n\nEquity:\n\n- Retained earnings: Net income is $118.80, so equity increases by that amount.\n\nNow, the income statement:\n\n- Revenue: $600\n\n- COGS: $300\n\n- Gross Profit: $300\n\n- Operating Expenses: $150\n\n- Operating Income: $150\n\n- Interest Expense: $18\n\n- EBT: $132\n\n- Tax: $13.20\n\n- Net Income: $118.80\n\nBalance Sheet:\n\nAssets:\n\n- Cash: $396\n\n- Inventory: $0\n\nTotal Assets: $396\n\nLiabilities:\n\n- Loan Payable: $264\n\nEquity:\n\n- Retained Earnings: $118.80\n\nTotal Liabilities + Equity: $264 + $118.80 = $382.80. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, total assets should equal total liabilities plus equity. But $396 vs $382.80. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, where's the error? Let's recalculate cash.\n\nInitial borrowing: +$300 cash, +$300 loan.\n\nBought goods: -$300 cash, +$300 inventory. So cash is 0, inventory 300.\n\nSold goods: +$600 cash, -$300 inventory. So cash is 600, inventory 0.\n\nOperating expenses: -$150 cash. Cash now 600 - 150 = 450.\n\nInterest: -$18. Cash 450 -18 = 432.\n\nRepayment of principal: -$36. Cash 432 -36 = 396. So cash is $396.\n\nLoan: started at 300, repaid 36, so 264.\n\nEquity: Net income is 118.80, so retained earnings +118.80.\n\nTotal assets: 396 (cash) + 0 (inventory) = 396.\n\nTotal liabilities + equity: 264 (loan) + 118.80 (retained earnings) = 382.80. Wait, that's a discrepancy of 13.20. Oh, because tax is a liability? Wait, tax expense is $13.20, so tax payable would be $13.20. So the tax is paid, but in the cash flow, did they pay the tax?\n\nWait, the problem says \"incurred $150 in operating expenses, paid 6% interest on the loan, and repaid 12% of the original principal.\" It doesn't mention paying taxes. So tax expense is $13.20, but the tax is not paid yet, so tax payable would be $13.20. So the balance sheet would have tax payable as a liability.\n\nSo liabilities: loan $264 + tax payable $13.20 = $277.20.\n\nEquity: $118.80.\n\nTotal liabilities + equity: 277.20 + 118.80 = 396, which matches assets. Ah, that's the mistake. I forgot that tax expense creates a tax payable liability.\n\nSo tax payable is $13.20.\n\nNow, cash flow statement:\n\nOperating activities: Net income $118.80, plus non-cash expenses (none here), but tax is a cash outflow. Wait, but tax expense is $13.20, so if they haven't paid it yet, it's a liability. But in the cash flow statement, operating activities would include cash paid for taxes. However, the problem doesn't state that they paid the tax, so perhaps the tax is still payable, so cash flow from operations would be net income adjusted for changes in working capital. But since tax payable increased by $13.20, that would mean cash paid for taxes is less than tax expense. Wait, tax expense is $13.20, but if tax payable increased by $13.20, then cash paid for taxes is zero. But the problem doesn't mention paying taxes, so we assume that the tax is not paid yet, so it's a liability.\n\nBut for the cash flow statement, the cash outflow for taxes would be zero in this case, but the tax expense is recognized. However, the problem might not require detailed cash flow, just the effects.\n\nBut the question is asking how the three statements are affected. So for the income statement, the key items are revenue, COGS, operating expenses, interest, tax, net income.\n\nBalance sheet: assets (cash, inventory), liabilities (loan, tax payable), equity (retained earnings).\n\nCash flow: operating, investing, financing.\n\nBut the problem might not need the cash flow statement details, just the overall effects.\n\nWait, the question says \"how are the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement affected after this transaction?\"\n\nSo I need to summarize the changes.\n\nIncome Statement:\n\n- Revenue: +$600\n\n- COGS: +$300\n\n- Gross Profit: +$300\n\n- Operating Expenses: +$150\n\n- Operating Income: +$150\n\n- Interest Expense: +$18\n\n- EBT: +$132\n\n- Tax Expense: +$13.20\n\n- Net Income: +$118.80\n\nBalance Sheet:\n\n- Assets: Cash increased by $396 (from initial borrowing and sales, minus expenses), Inventory decreased by $300 (sold), so net asset change: +$96 (396 - 300? Wait, no. Initial assets: when borrowed, cash +300, then spent to buy inventory, so assets were 300 (inventory). Then sold inventory for cash: inventory -300, cash +600. So assets: 600 cash. Then paid expenses: cash -150-18-36= -204, so cash 396. So assets are 396 cash, 0 inventory. So total assets increased by 396 - 0 (assuming before the transaction, assets were 0? Wait, no. The firm existed before, but the problem is about the transaction. So the changes are:\n\n- Cash: +$396 (from the transactions)\n\n- Inventory: -$300 (sold)\n\nSo net change in assets: +$96.\n\nLiabilities:\n\n- Loan: -$36 (repaid), so liability decreased by $36.\n\n- Tax Payable: +$13.20 (tax expense)\n\nSo total liabilities change: -36 +13.20 = -$22.80.\n\nEquity:\n\n- Retained Earnings: +$118.80 (net income)\n\nSo total liabilities + equity change: -$22.80 + $118.80 = +$96, which matches asset change.\n\nCash Flow Statement:\n\nOperating Activities: Net income $118.80, but tax payable increased by $13.20, so cash from operations would be net income minus increase in tax payable? Wait, cash flow from operations is typically net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital. Here, tax payable increased by $13.20, so cash paid for taxes is tax expense minus increase in tax payable. If tax expense is $13.20 and tax payable increased by $13.20, then cash paid for taxes is zero. So cash flow from operations would be $118.80 (net income) + $0 (since tax payable increase is a non-cash expense adjustment? Wait, no. The formula is:\n\nNet cash from operations = Net income + non-cash expenses - increase in working capital (excluding cash).\n\nTax expense is a non-cash expense? No, tax expense is a cash expense if paid, but here it's not paid, so tax payable increased. So the adjustment would be to subtract the increase in tax payable.\n\nSo cash flow from operations = $118.80 - $13.20 = $105.60.\n\nBut maybe the problem doesn't require that level of detail. The question is about how the statements are affected, so perhaps listing the key changes.\n\nBut the problem might expect a concise answer. Let's see what the key points are.\n\nIncome Statement: Revenue $600, COGS $300, OpEx $150, Interest $18, Tax $13.20, Net Income $118.80.\n\nBalance Sheet: Cash +$396, Loan Payable -$36, Tax Payable +$13.20, Retained Earnings +$118.80.\n\nCash Flow: Operating activities: Net income $118.80, but tax payable increase means cash flow from operations is $118.80 - $13.20 = $105.60. Investing: none (buying goods was part of operations, not investing). Financing: repayment of loan $36, so cash outflow of $36.\n\nBut the question might just want the net effects on each statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"how are the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement affected\". So perhaps list the changes.\n\nBut the answer needs to be concise in financial format. The user probably expects the key figures.\n\nWait, the problem might not require all the details, but the main effects. Let's see.\n\nAnother way: the income statement shows a net income of $118.80. The balance sheet shows cash increased by $396 (from the initial $0 after borrowing and buying goods), loan decreased by $36, tax payable increased by $13.20, and equity increased by $118.80. The cash flow statement would show operating cash flow of $105.60 (net income minus tax payable increase), financing cash flow of -$36 (repayment of loan).\n\nBut the problem might want the answer in terms of the changes to the statements, not the detailed line items.\n\nWait, the question says \"how are the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement affected\". So perhaps the answer should state the key changes.\n\nBut the user instructions say \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\".\n\nLooking at similar problems, the answer might be the net income, and the changes in assets, liabilities, etc.\n\nBut the problem might expect the net income amount as the key point for the income statement, and for the balance sheet, the changes in cash, loan, etc., but since it's a concise answer, maybe just the net income and the cash flow effects.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for how all three statements are affected. However, the answer format requires a concise answer. Maybe the key is to state the net income, and the cash flow from operations, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's check the numbers again.\n\nNet income is $118.80.\n\nOn the balance sheet, cash is $396 (increase of $396 from initial cash of $0 after the borrowing and purchasing, but actually, the initial borrowing increased cash by $300, then spent it, so cash was zero, then sales brought in $600, minus expenses, so net cash increase is $396.\n\nLoan decreased by $36.\n\nTax payable increased by $13.20.\n\nEquity increased by $118.80.\n\nFor the cash flow statement:\n\nOperating activities: Net income $118.80, but tax payable increased by $13.20, so cash from operations is $118.80 - $13.20 = $105.60.\n\nInvesting activities: none (buying goods is part of operations, not investing).\n\nFinancing activities: repayment of loan $36, so -$36.\n\nSo total cash flow: $105.60 - $36 = $69.60. But the cash increased by $396? Wait, no. Wait, the cash flow should equal the change in cash. Let's see:\n\nCash flow from operations: $105.60\n\nCash flow from financing: -$36\n\nTotal cash flow: $105.60 - $36 = $69.60\n\nBut the actual cash change is $396. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no. The initial borrowing was a financing inflow of $300. Then the repayment is a financing outflow of $36. So financing activities: +$300 (borrowing) - $36 (repayment) = +$264.\n\nOperating activities: $105.60\n\nInvesting: none.\n\nSo total cash flow: $264 + $105.60 = $369.60. But the cash change is $396. Hmm, discrepancy.\n\nWait, the borrowing is a financing inflow of $300. Then the cash from operations is $105.60, financing outflow of $36. So total cash change: 300 (borrowing) + 105.60 (op) -36 (repayment) = 300 + 69.60 = 369.60. But earlier calculation said cash is $396. So where's the mistake?\n\nAh, because when they sold the goods for $600, that's revenue, so cash inflow of $600. Then operating expenses $150, interest $18, repayment $36. So cash inflows: $600 (sales) + $300 (borrowing) = $900.\n\nCash outflows: $300 (buying goods) + $150 (opex) + $18 (interest) + $36 (repayment) = $504.\n\nNet cash change: $900 - $504 = $396. Which matches.\n\nSo cash flow statement:\n\nOperating: $600 (sales) - $150 (opex) - $18 (interest) = $432. But wait, interest is a financing expense? No, interest is an operating expense for some companies, but typically, interest is a financing activity. Wait, no: interest paid is usually classified as an operating activity under US GAAP, but sometimes as financing. But in cash flow statements, interest paid is often classified as operating.\n\nBut regardless, the cash flow from operations would include the revenue and expenses, but not the interest and principal repayment.\n\nWait, the cash flow statement:\n\nOperating activities: cash received from customers ($600) - cash paid for operating expenses ($150) = $450. But interest is usually considered operating, so cash paid for interest ($18) would be part of operating. So operating cash flow: $600 - $150 - $18 = $432.\n\nFinancing activities: cash received from borrowing ($300) - cash paid to repay loan ($36) = $264.\n\nInvesting activities: none.\n\nTotal cash flow: $432 + $264 = $696. Wait, but the actual cash change is $396. This is confusing.\n\nWait, no. The borrowing is a financing inflow of $300. The cash from operations is $600 (sales) - $150 (opex) - $18 (interest) = $432. Then financing: +$300 (borrowing) - $36 (repayment) = +$264. So total cash flow: $432 + $264 = $696. But the actual cash change is $396. So where's the error?\n\nAh, because the $300 borrowed was used to buy goods, so the $300 is a cash outflow for purchasing inventory, which is part of operating activities. Wait, no: when you borrow, it's a financing inflow. When you use the cash to buy inventory, that's an operating outflow (since inventory is part of operations). So:\n\nCash flow from operations:\n\n- Cash received from sales: $600\n\n- Cash paid for inventory: $300 (but this was the initial purchase, which was part of the borrowing)\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to stick to the net cash change.\n\nThe firm started with no cash (assuming), borrowed $300 (cash +300), spent $300 on goods (cash -300), sold goods for $600 (cash +600), paid $150 opex (cash -150), paid $18 interest (cash -18), repaid $36 (cash -36).\n\nSo total cash change: +300 -300 +600 -150 -18 -36 = 396.\n\nSo the cash flow statement would have:\n\nOperating: +600 (sales) -300 (inventory purchase) -150 (opex) -18 (interest) = +132. But inventory purchase is part of operating, so yes.\n\nFinancing: +300 (borrowing) -36 (repayment) = +264.\n\nTotal: 132 + 264 = 396. Which matches.\n\nBut the problem might not require this level of detail. The question is likely expecting the net income for the income statement, and the changes in cash, loan, etc., for the balance sheet, and the cash flow effects.\n\nBut given the instructions, the final answer should be concise. The key figure is probably the net income of $118.80, but the problem might want the answer in a specific format.\n\nWait, the problem says \"how are the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement affected\". So perhaps the answer should state the net income, the cash balance, and the loan balance, but in a concise way.\n\nBut the user instructions say \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\".\n\nLooking at similar problems, the answer might be the net income amount, as that's the key for the income statement, and the balance sheet changes are reflected in the cash and loan, but the question might just want the net income.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions all the transactions, so the net income is the key number.\n\nLet me confirm the net income calculation:\n\nRevenue: 600\n\nCOGS: 300\n\nGross Profit: 300\n\nOperating Expenses: 150\n\nOperating Income: 150\n\nInterest Expense: 6% of 300 = 18\n\nEBT: 150 - 18 = 132\n\nTax: 10% of 132 = 13.20\n\nNet Income: 132 - 13.20 = 118.80\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the income statement shows a net income of $118.80.\n\nThe balance sheet would show an increase in cash by $396, a decrease in loan by $36, an increase in tax payable by $13.20, and an increase in retained earnings by $118.80.\n\nThe cash flow statement would show operating cash flow of $432 (600 - 150 - 18), financing cash flow of $264 (300 - 36), and total cash increase of $696? Wait, no, earlier calculation showed cash change is $396. I think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nGiven the instructions, the most concise answer that captures the key effect is the net income of $118.80. But the question asks for all three statements. However, the answer format requires a single concise answer.\n\nWait, the problem might expect the net income as the main point, but the instructions say \"how are the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement affected\". So perhaps the answer should list the key changes.\n\nBut the user says \"final answer must be concise, in the correct financial format\".\n\nIn many such problems, the key answer is the net income. So I'll go with $118.80.\n\nWait, but let's check if the tax is applied correctly. EBT is $132, tax rate 10%, so tax is $13.20, net income $118.80. Yes.\n\nSo the income statement's net income is $118.80.\n\nThe balance sheet's cash is $396, loan is $264, tax payable $13.20, equity $118.80.\n\nCash flow: operating $432, financing $264.\n\nBut the problem likely wants the net income as the key figure for the income statement, and the answer is the net income amount.\n\nSo the final answer is $118.80.\n\nBut let's confirm once more.\n\nYes, all steps check out. So the net income is $118.80.\n</think>\n\n<answer>:118.80",

      "question": "Company X buys back stock with debt. How does that impact the P/E ratio of the company?",
      "ground_truth": "P/E ratio typically decreases",
      "predicted_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about how a company buying back stock with debt affects its P/E ratio. First, I need to recall what the P/E ratio is. The P/E ratio is calculated as the market price per share divided by earnings per share (EPS). So, any change that affects either the price or the EPS will impact the P/E.\n\nThe company is buying back stock using debt. When a company buys back shares, it reduces the number of shares outstanding. Since EPS is net income divided by shares outstanding, fewer shares would mean higher EPS, assuming net income stays the same. So, if EPS increases, and the market price per share might stay the same or change, but let's think about that.\n\nWait, the question is about the impact on the P/E ratio. If EPS goes up because shares are repurchased, then for the same market price, the P/E ratio would decrease. But does the market price change? The market might react to the buyback, but the question is probably assuming that the market price remains constant for the sake of this calculation. So, higher EPS leads to a lower P/E ratio.\n\nBut wait, the company is using debt to buy back the stock. Taking on debt might affect the company's financial risk, which could influence the market's perception of the stock price. However, the question doesn't mention any change in the market price, so maybe we're to assume that the market price per share doesn't change immediately due to the buyback. So, the main effect is the reduction in shares outstanding, increasing EPS, thus lowering the P/E ratio.\n\nLet me double-check. Suppose the company has $100 million in net income and 10 million shares. EPS is $10. P/E is, say, 20. If they buy back 2 million shares, now 8 million shares. EPS becomes $12.5. If the market price stays at $250 (since P/E was 20, 20*12.5=250), then the new P/E would be 250/12.5=20. Wait, that's the same. Wait, no. Wait, if the market price is based on the previous P/E, but actually, the market price might adjust. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nActually, the P/E ratio is price divided by EPS. If the company repurchases shares, EPS increases. If the market price doesn't change immediately (which is a simplification), then the P/E ratio would decrease. For example, if EPS goes from $10 to $12.5, and price stays at $200, then P/E was 20, now it's 16. So, the P/E ratio decreases.\n\nBut the use of debt might affect the company's risk, which could lead to a lower market price. However, the question is about the direct effect of the buyback on the P/E ratio, not the indirect effects from increased debt. So, the primary effect is the increase in EPS due to fewer shares, leading to a lower P/E ratio.\n\nWait, but if the company takes on debt, that might increase interest expenses, which could reduce net income. Oh, right! The question says \"buys back stock with debt,\" so they're taking on debt, which means higher interest expense. If net income decreases because of higher interest, then EPS might not increase as much, or could even decrease. But the question doesn't specify whether the interest expense is significant enough to offset the share reduction.\n\nHmm, this is a point I might have missed. Let's think: buying back stock with debt. The company issues debt, so they have to pay interest. If the interest expense is high, net income could decrease. So, the effect on EPS is two-fold: fewer shares (increasing EPS) but lower net income (decreasing EPS). The net effect depends on which is larger.\n\nBut the question is probably assuming that the interest expense is not significant, or that the primary effect is the share count reduction. In many textbook examples, when they talk about share buybacks, they focus on the EPS increase from fewer shares, ignoring the debt impact on net income. So, the standard answer would be that the P/E ratio decreases because EPS increases.\n\nWait, but the question says \"buys back stock with debt,\" so the debt is a factor. However, in the absence of specific numbers, the standard reasoning is that the reduction in shares leads to higher EPS, thus lower P/E. The debt aspect might be a distractor, but the main effect is the share count.\n\nSo, the answer should be that the P/E ratio decreases.\n</think>\n\nWhen a company buys back stock with debt, the number of shares outstanding decreases. Assuming net income remains unchanged (ignoring potential interest expense impacts for simplicity), earnings per share (EPS) increases. Since the P/E ratio is calculated as market price per share divided by EPS, a higher EPS leads to a lower P/E ratio, all else being equal.\n\n<answer>:decreases",
