      "ground_truth": "$32,095 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": " To calculate the Gross Profit for the year ending 2024, we first need to find Net Sales and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Then, subtract COGS from Net Sales to get Gross Profit.\n\n1. Net Sales:\n   - Total Net Sales for the year 2024 is $249,625 million as given in the results of operations section.\n\n2. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):\n   - Unfortunately, the COGS for the year ending 2024 is not provided in the text. However, we can estimate COGS by using the Gross Margin percentage from previous years and applying it to Net Sales for 2024.\n   - For simplicity, let's assume that the Gross Margin percentage has remained constant over the years (which may not be accurate but will give us an approximate value). In 2023, the Gross Margin was approximately 21% (Net Sales of $237,710 million and Gross Profit of $49,586 million).\n   - Using this percentage, we can estimate COGS for 2024 as follows:\n     COGS = Net Sales * (1 - Gross Margin Percentage)\n     COGS = $249,625 million * (1 - 0.21)\n     COGS ≈ $249,625 million * 0.8\n     COGS ≈ $199,698 million\n\n3. Gross Profit:\n   - Now that we have Net Sales and COGS, we can calculate Gross Profit:\n     Gross Profit = Net Sales - COGS\n     Gross Profit = $249,625 million - $199,698 million\n     Gross Profit ≈ $49,927 million\n\nSo, the estimated Gross Profit for the year ending 2024 is approximately $49,927 million. Keep in mind that this calculation assumes a constant Gross Margin percentage over the years, which may not be accurate. The actual Gross Profit could differ based on the company's financial statements.",

Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Find Operating Income:\n   - From the provided results, we can see that for 2024, the operating income was $9,285 million for the U.S., $1,648 million for Canada, and $1,420 million for Other International. Add these figures together to get the total operating income:\n     Total Operating Income = $9,285 + $1,648 + $1,420 = $12,353 million\n\n2. Find Depreciation and Amortization (D&A):\n   - From the provided results, we can see that for 2024, the D&A was $2,237 million for the U.S., $192 million for Canada, and $315 million for Other International. Add these figures together to get the total D&A:\n     Total D&A = $2,237 + $192 + $315 = $2,744 million\n\n3. Calculate EBITDA:\n   - Subtract the total D&A from the total operating income to find the EBITDA:\n     EBITDA = Total Operating Income - Total D&A = $12,353 - $2,744 = $9,609 million\n\n4. Find Net Sales:\n   - From the provided results, we can see that the net sales for 2024 were $249,625 million.\n\n5. Calculate Unadjusted EBITDA Margin:\n   - Divide the EBITDA by the net sales to find the margin as a percentage:\n     Unadjusted EBITDA Margin = (EBITDA / Net Sales) * 100% = ($9,609 / $249,625) * 100% ≈ 3.84%\n\nSo, the unadjusted EBITDA margin for 2024 is approximately 3.84%.",

However, the provided financial statements do not contain the necessary data for calculating EPS directly. Let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Net Income: The net income can be found in the \"Results of Operations\" section. For 2024, it is $6,758 million.\n\n2. Dividends: To calculate EPS, we need to subtract dividends paid per share from the net income. Unfortunately, the financial statements do not provide information about dividends. If we assume no dividends were paid (which might not be accurate), then the net income would equal the earnings for the year.\n\n3. Number of Shares Outstanding: To find the EPS, we need to divide the net income by the number of shares outstanding. The financial statements do not provide this information directly, but it can often be found in a company's annual report or investor relations section on their website. If you cannot find the exact number for 2024, you may use the most recent available data as an approximation.\n\n4. P/E Ratio: Once we have the EPS, we can calculate the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio by dividing the market capitalization (the total value of all outstanding shares of a company's stock) by the earnings per share (EPS). The market capitalization can be found by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the current stock price. As we do not have the number of shares outstanding or the current stock price, we cannot calculate the P/E ratio directly from the provided information.\n\nIn summary, to find the P/E ratio for 2024 using Basic EPS, you would need additional data such as the number of shares outstanding and the current stock price.

      "predicted_answer": " To calculate the Equity Value for the year 2024, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine Total Debt:\n   - From the provided data, we don't have explicit information about the company's debt. However, we can find it indirectly by calculating the Enterprise Value (EV) and subtracting the total assets from it.\n\n2. Calculate Total Assets:\n   - Add up all the assets mentioned in the \"Properties\" section and the \"Segment Reporting\" table for the year 2024.\n\n3. Calculate Total Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity:\n   - Subtract Total Debt from Total Assets to find Total Liabilities. Then, subtract Total Liabilities from Total Assets to find Stockholders' Equity.\n\n4. Calculate Enterprise Value (EV):\n   - Multiply the calculated Total Assets by (1 - Tax Rate) to adjust for taxes and then add back excess cash (if provided). Finally, subtract Total Debt to get the EV.\n\n5. Calculate Equity Value:\n   - The Equity Value is equal to the Enterprise Value minus the total debt calculated in step 2.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Tax Rate: Not provided, let's assume a tax rate of 30%.\n- Excess Cash: Not provided, assuming no excess cash for simplicity.\n\nSteps:\n1. Total Debt = Total Assets - Total Liabilities (not given)\n2. Total Assets = 48,816 (U.S.) + 6,915 (Canada) + 14,100 (Other International) + 29,032 (Property and Equipment, U.S.) + 2,602 (Property and Equipment, Canada) + 5,792 (Property and Equipment, Other International) = $82,261 million\n3. Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Enterprise Value (assumed to be 420 billion) = 82,261 - 420,000 = -337,739 million (Negative value indicates total liabilities are greater than total assets, which is not possible. This assumption might be incorrect.)\n4. Stockholders' Equity = Total Assets - Total Liabilities = Not calculable with the given data\n5. Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Total Debt = 420,000 - (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) = Not calculable with the given data\n\nSince we cannot calculate the Equity Value with the provided information, it is necessary to have more details about the company's debt or adjust the assumptions regarding the tax rate and excess cash.",

      "predicted_answer": " To estimate the Cost of Equity using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for 2024, we need to gather the following components:\n\n1. Risk-free Rate (Rf): This is typically represented by the yield on a government bond with a comparable maturity. As of March 31, 2023, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield was around 2.4%. However, for our analysis, we will use the average yield during 2024, which is not yet available. We can estimate it by taking an average of the yields from different points in 2024.\n\n2. Beta (β): This measures a stock's sensitivity to market movements. For Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST), the beta is approximately 0.65. This value indicates that COST's stock price tends to move 65% as much as the S&P 500 index.\n\n3. Market Return (Rm): This represents the return of the market portfolio, which can be approximated by the return of a broad market index like the S&P 500. As of March 31, 2023, the S&P 500's one-year trailing total return was around 26%. However, for our analysis, we will use the average return during 2024, which is not yet available. We can estimate it by taking an average of the returns from different points in 2024.\n\nNow, let's calculate the Cost of Equity (Ke) using the CAPM formula:\n\nKe = Rf + β * (Rm - Rf)\n\nOnce we have the values for Rf, β, and the average market return (Rm) during 2024, we can calculate the Cost of Equity. Keep in mind that the actual values will be estimates based on the data available as of March 31, 2023.\n\nAfter calculating Ke, you may want to compare it with COST's historical cost of equity and its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to assess whether the company's equity is appropriately priced or if there are potential opportunities for further growth.",

      "predicted_answer": " To calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for 2024, we need to gather and calculate several components:\n\n1. Cost of Equity (r_e): This can be estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The formula is r_e = risk-free rate + beta * market risk premium.\n   - Risk-free rate (r_f) can be approximated by the 10-year Treasury bond yield. As of March 29, 2023, it was around 2.4%.\n   - Beta (β) represents the systematic risk of Costco's stock compared to the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock moves with the market, while a beta greater than 1 means it is more volatile. Costco's beta is approximately 0.65.\n   - Market risk premium (r_m - r_f) can be estimated as the historical return of the S&P 500 minus the risk-free rate. As of March 29, 2023, it was around 5.4%.\n   So, r_e = 2.4% + 0.65 * 5.4% = 4.17% (approximately)\n\n2. Cost of Debt (r_d): This is the interest rate that Costco pays on its debt. As of March 29, 2023, Costco's weighted average interest rate on long-term debt was around 2.8%.\n\n3. Market Value of Equity (MVE) and Market Value of Debt (MVD): These can be estimated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the current stock price for equity and total long-term debt for debt. As of March 29, 2023, Costco's market cap was around $165 billion, and its total long-term debt was approximately $14.8 billion.\n\n4. Tax rate (t): Costco's effective tax rate is around 27%.\n\nNow we can calculate WACC:\n\nWACC = (MVE / (MVE + MVD)) * r_e + (MVD / (MVE + MVD)) * t * r_d\n\nPlug in the values:\n\nWACC = ((165,000,000,000) / (165,000,000,000 + 14,800,000,000)) * 4.17% + ((14,800,000,000) / (165,000,000,000 + 14,800,000,000)) * 27% * 2.8%\n\nWACC = 0.91 * 4.17% + 0.08 * 27% * 2.8%\n\nWACC = 3.75% (approximately)",

      "predicted_answer": " To find the Operating Cash Tax Rate for the year 2024, we need to calculate the effective tax rate by dividing the income taxes paid by the operating income. Here's how:\n\n1. First, let's find the operating income:\n   - From the provided data, we can see that the Operating Income for the year 2024 is $9,285 million (for the United States segment).\n\n2. Next, we need to find the total income taxes paid during the same period. Unfortunately, the provided information does not contain the exact amount of income taxes paid in 2024. However, we can calculate an estimated effective tax rate based on the Operating Income and the reported cash tax expense for the year 2023.\n\n   - In 2023, the Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $10,657 million (from the Cash Flow Statement), and the Income Tax Expense was $2,489 million (from the Income Statement).\n   - Therefore, the effective tax rate for 2023 would be:\n     Effective Tax Rate = Income Tax Expense / Operating Income\n     Effective Tax Rate = $2,489 million / $10,657 million ≈ 23.5% (approx.)\n\n3. Since the provided data does not contain the exact income taxes paid in 2024, we can use this estimated effective tax rate from 2023 to calculate an approximate Operating Cash Tax Rate for 2024:\n   - Approximate Operating Cash Tax Rate = Income Tax Expense (estimated) / Operating Income (2024)\n   - Approximate Operating Cash Tax Rate = $9,285 million * 23.5% ≈ $2,167 million (approx.)",

      "predicted_answer": " To determine the Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding for the year 2024, we need to consider the following share classes:\n\n1. Common Stock: This is the basic shares issued by the company and represents the ownership claims of common stockholders.\n\n2. Stock Options: These are contracts that give the holder the right to buy a specific number of shares at a predetermined price (strike price) within a certain time frame.\n\n3. Warrants: These are similar to stock options but are often issued by companies as a financing mechanism and can be exercised by holders to purchase shares at a specified price.\n\n4. Convertible Securities: These are debt instruments that can be converted into common stock under certain conditions.\n\nIn the absence of specific data about the number of outstanding options, warrants, and convertible securities, and their conversion rates, it is not possible to calculate the exact fully diluted shares outstanding for 2024. However, we can provide a general approach to calculating fully diluted shares:\n\n1. Count the total number of common shares outstanding (this information should be available in the financial statements).\n2. For each stock option, warrant, or convertible security, calculate the number of additional shares that could potentially be issued if all options were exercised, warrants were converted, and convertible securities were converted into common stock. This is done by dividing the total number of shares underlying these instruments by their respective exercise prices (or conversion price for convertible securities).\n3. Add the total number of additional shares calculated in step 2 to the number of common shares outstanding from step 1. The result is the fully diluted share count.",

      "question": "Calculate the Unlevered Beta for 2024.",
      "ground_truth": "0.77",
      "predicted_answer": " To calculate the unlevered beta (βu), we need to find the company's levered beta (βl) and then adjust it for financial leverage. The formula for calculating unlevered beta is:\n\nβu = βl * (1 / (1 + Leverage Ratio))\n\nFirst, let's find the levered beta (βl). We can use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to calculate it. The CAPM formula is:\n\nβl = Rf - Rer  /  Rm - Rf\n\nWhere:\n- Rf is the risk-free rate\n- Rer is the expected return on the market portfolio\n- Rm is the company's return on the market portfolio\n\nAssuming a risk-free rate (Rf) of 2%, an expected return on the market portfolio (Rer) of 8%, and a company's return on the market portfolio (Rm) of 10% for 2024, we can calculate the levered beta as follows:\n\nβl = 8% - 2% / 10% - 2% = 0.6\n\nNext, let's find the Leverage Ratio. The Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Debt by Equity. From the provided financial statements, we can see that:\n\n- Total Assets (Equity + Total Debt) for 2024 is $69,831 million\n- Equity for 2024 is $48,816 million\n\nAssuming Total Debt for 2024 is the difference between Total Assets and Equity:\n\nTotal Debt = Total Assets - Equity = $69,831 - $48,816 = $20,975 million\n\nNow we can calculate the Leverage Ratio:\n\nLeverage Ratio = Total Debt / Equity = $20,975 / $48,816 ≈ 0.43\n\nFinally, let's find the unlevered beta (βu):\n\nβu = βl * (1 / (1 + Leverage Ratio)) = 0.6 * (1 / (1 + 0.43)) ≈ 0.37\n\nSo, the unlevered beta for 2024 is approximately 0.37. This value represents the sensitivity of the company's operating income to changes in the market portfolio return, assuming no financial leverage.",

      "ground_truth": "$11,415 (in millions)",
      "predicted_answer": " To compute the debt for 2024, we need to consider both traditional debt (short-term and long-term liabilities) and debt equivalents (off-balance sheet obligations). Here's a structured analysis:\n\n1. Traditional Debt:\n   - Short-Term Liabilities: These are obligations due within one year. In the provided data, there is no information about short-term liabilities.\n   - Long-Term Liabilities: These are obligations due after one year. The given data includes Property and Equipment, net for each segment. However, it's important to note that these figures represent assets (buildings and equipment) rather than liabilities. To find long-term debt, we would need information about the corresponding long-term borrowings.\n\n2. Debt Equivalents:\n   - Operating Leases: The data mentions 134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building. This suggests that there might be significant operating lease obligations for buildings and equipment that Costco does not own. According to accounting standards, operating leases should be recognized as a liability on the balance sheet. However, since we don't have specific numbers for these liabilities, they cannot be included in our calculation.\n   - Contingent Liabilities: The company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12 months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. If certain matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual fiscal quarter or year. However, since we don't have specific numbers for these potential liabilities, they cannot be included in our calculation.\n   - Pension Obligations: The data does not provide information about pension obligations, if any. If Costco has defined benefit pension plans, the associated liabilities should be recognized on the balance sheet. However, without this information, we can't include it in our calculation.\n\nIn conclusion, due to the lack of specific numbers for several types of debt and debt equivalents, it is not possible to compute an accurate figure for total debt for 2024 based on the provided data.",

Calculate Total Assets for each year:\n   - From the provided data in Note 8 (Properties) and Note 11 (Segment Reporting), we can see that the total assets for each reportable segment (U.S., Canada, Other International) are given for both years 2024 and 2023.\n   - Add up the total assets for all segments to get the Total Assets for each year.\n\n2. Calculate Goodwill for each year:\n   - Unfortunately, the provided data does not contain specific information about Goodwill for each year. However, we can find the Goodwill amount by looking at the \"Property and Equipment, net\" value in Note 8 (Properties) and subtracting Depreciation and Amortization from it. This method assumes that all depreciation and amortization is applied to Goodwill.\n   - Calculate Goodwill for each year using the following formula:\n     Goodwill = Property and Equipment, net - Depreciation and Amortization\n\n3. Calculate Average Invested Capital (AIC) for each year:\n   - AIC includes Total Assets and Goodwill.\n     AIC = Total Assets + Goodwill\n\n4. Find the average of AIC for both years:\n   - Average AIC = (AIC_2023 + AIC_2024) / 2\n\nHere's a table to help visualize the calculations:\n\n| Year | Total Assets | Goodwill | AIC |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 2023 | TBD | TBD | TBD |\n| 2024 | TBD | TBD | TBD |\n\nAfter calculating the values for each year, we can find the average AIC including Goodwill for both years.",

Total Assets (2023): From the provided data, we can see that the total assets for 2023 were $68,994 million.\n\n2. Non-operating Assets: Unfortunately, the information provided does not explicitly state non-operating assets. However, we can make an educated guess and exclude property and equipment as they are considered operating assets in this context. So, let's subtract property and equipment from total assets to get a rough estimate of non-operating assets.\n   - Non-operating Assets (rough estimate): $68,994 million - $26,684 million (property and equipment) = $42,310 million\n\n3. Current Liabilities: The provided data does not include current liabilities. However, for a rough estimate, we can assume that current liabilities are a small portion of total assets, considering the nature of Costco's business. Let's assume 20% of total assets as current liabilities.\n   - Current Liabilities (rough estimate): $68,994 million * 0.2 = $13,799 million\n\n4.

Portion of Other Long-Term Operating Liabilities Not Accounted For:\n   - Since we don't have the information about other long-term operating liabilities, we cannot calculate this portion accurately. However, if we assume that the structure is similar to the assets, then the portion not accounted for would be approximately $18,308 million ($23,240 million - $4,932 million, which is the property and equipment, net for Other International as of September 1, 2024).\n\nIn conclusion, without more detailed information about other long-term operating liabilities, we cannot provide an accurate answer to the question. However, if we assume that the structure is similar to the assets, then the portion of other long-term assets not accounted for in 2024, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for, would be approximately $18,308 million - $23,240 million = -$4,932 million (approximately). This means that there is a deficit in the reported data.",
